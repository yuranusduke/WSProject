Simon Jenni#DILEMMA: Self-Supervised Shape and Texture Learning with Transformers#There is a growing belief that deep neural networks with a shape bias may exhibit better generalization capabilities than models with a texture bias, because shape is a more reliable indicator of the object category.

Simon Jenni#Learning to Have an Ear for Face Super-Resolution#We propose a novel method to use both audio and a low-resolution image to perform extreme face super-resolution (a 16x increase of the input size). When the resolution of the input image is very low (e.g., 8x8 pixels), the loss of information is so dire that important details of the original identity have been lost and audio can aid the recovery of a plausible high-resolution image. In fact, audio…

As shown in recent analysis, training is often undermined by the probability distribution of the data being zero on neighborhoods of the data space. We notice that the distributions of real and generated data should match even when they undergo the same filtering. Therefore, to address the lim…

Rudolph#Nonparametric causal mediation analysis for stochastic interventional (in)direct effects#Causal mediation analysis has historically been limited in two important ways: (i) a focus has traditionally been placed on binary treatments and static interventions, and (ii) direct and indirect effect decompositions have been pursued that are only identifiable in the absence of intermediate confounders affected by treatment. We present a theoretical study of an (in)direct effect decomposition o…
Kara E. Rudolph#Efficiently transporting causal (in)direct effects to new populations under intermediate confounding and with multiple mediators#The same intervention can produce different effects in different sites. Transport mediation estimators can estimate the extent to which such differences can be explained by differences in compositional factors and the mechanisms by which mediating or intermediate variables are produced; however, they are limited to consider a single, binary mediator. We propose novel nonparametric estimators of tr…
Kara E. Rudolph#Non-parametric efficient causal mediation with intermediate confounders#Interventional effects for mediation analysis were proposed as a solution to the lack of identifiability of natural (in)direct effects in the presence of a mediator-outcome confounder affected by exposure.

Kara E. Rudolph#Robust and Flexible Estimation of Stochastic Mediation Effects: A Proposed Method and Example in a Randomized Trial Setting#Causal mediation analysis can improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying epidemiologic associations. However, the utility of natural direct and indirect effect estimation has been limited by the assumption of no confounder of the mediator-outcome relationship that is affected by prior exposure---an assumption frequently violated in practice. We build on recent work that identified alternat…
Abhinav Natarajan#On a wider class of prior distributions for graphical models#Gaussian graphical models are useful tools for conditional independence structure inference of multivariate random variables.

Motivated by this challenging problem in brain signal anal…
Shuhao Jiao#Variation Pattern Classification of Functional Data#A new classification method for functional data is proposed in this paper. This work is motivated by the need to identify features that discriminate between neurological conditions on which local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded.

For such classification tasks, in comparison with the accuracy rate, it is usually much more appropriate to use non-decomposable performance measures such as the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) and the $F_β$ measure as the classification criterion since the label class is imbalanced. On the…
