Simon Jenni#DILEMMA: Self-Supervised Shape and Texture Learning with Transformers#There is a growing belief that deep neural networks with a shape bias may exhibit better generalization capabilities than models with a texture bias, because shape is a more reliable indicator of the object category. However, we show experimentally that existing measures of shape bias are not stable predictors of generalization and argue that shape discrimination should not come at the expense of…
Simon Jenni#Learning to Deblur and Rotate Motion-Blurred Faces#We propose a solution to the novel task of rendering sharp videos from new viewpoints from a single motion-blurred image of a face.

The fi…
Simon Jenni#Time-Equivariant Contrastive Video Representation Learning#We introduce a novel self-supervised contrastive learning method to learn representations from unlabelled videos. Existing approaches ignore the specifics of input distortions, e.g., by learning invariance to temporal transformations.

Simon Jenni#Steering Self-Supervised Feature Learning Beyond Local Pixel Statistics#We introduce a novel principle for self-supervised feature learning based on the discrimination of specific transformations of an image.

Simon Jenni#Learning to Have an Ear for Face Super-Resolution#We propose a novel method to use both audio and a low-resolution image to perform extreme face super-resolution (a 16x increase of the input size). When the resolution of the input image is very low (e.g., 8x8 pixels), the loss of information is so dire that important details of the original identity have been lost and audio can aid the recovery of a plausible high-resolution image. In fact, audio…
Simon Jenni#On Stabilizing Generative Adversarial Training with Noise#We present a novel method and analysis to train generative adversarial networks (GAN) in a stable manner. As shown in recent analysis, training is often undermined by the probability distribution of the data being zero on neighborhoods of the data space. We notice that the distributions of real and generated data should match even when they undergo the same filtering. Therefore, to address the lim…

This formulation allows us to define the optimizatio…

To generate images with artifacts, we pre-train a high-capacity autoencoder and then w…

Rudolph#Nonparametric causal mediation analysis for stochastic interventional (in)direct effects#Causal mediation analysis has historically been limited in two important ways: (i) a focus has traditionally been placed on binary treatments and static interventions, and (ii) direct and indirect effect decompositions have been pursued that are only identifiable in the absence of intermediate confounders affected by treatment. We present a theoretical study of an (in)direct effect decomposition o…
Kara E. Rudolph#Efficiently transporting causal (in)direct effects to new populations under intermediate confounding and with multiple mediators#The same intervention can produce different effects in different sites. Transport mediation estimators can estimate the extent to which such differences can be explained by differences in compositional factors and the mechanisms by which mediating or intermediate variables are produced; however, they are limited to consider a single, binary mediator. We propose novel nonparametric estimators of tr…
Kara E. Rudolph#Non-parametric efficient causal mediation with intermediate confounders#Interventional effects for mediation analysis were proposed as a solution to the lack of identifiability of natural (in)direct effects in the presence of a mediator-outcome confounder affected by exposure.

Kara E. Rudolph#Robust and Flexible Estimation of Stochastic Mediation Effects: A Proposed Method and Example in a Randomized Trial Setting#Causal mediation analysis can improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying epidemiologic associations.
