multimedia. With the development of advanced driver assistance systems~(ADAS)
and their applications in autonomous vehicles, experimenting with different
scenarios becomes a challenge. Although the photo-realistic street scenes can
be synthesized by image-to-image translation methods, which cannot produce
coherent scenes due to the lack of 3D information. In this paper, a large-scale
neural rendering method is proposed to synthesize the autonomous driving
scene~(READ), which makes it possible to synthesize large-scale driving
scenarios on a PC through a variety of sampling schemes. In order to represent
driving scenarios, we propose an {\omega} rendering network to learn neural
descriptors from sparse point clouds. Our model can not only synthesize
realistic driving scenes but also stitch and edit driving scenes. Experiments
show that our model performs well in large-scale driving scenarios."#

(11 additional authors not shown)#"This paper reviews the NTIRE 2022 challenge on efficient single image
super-resolution with focus on the proposed solutions and results. The task of
the challenge was to super-resolve an input image with a magnification factor
of $\times$4 based on pairs of low and corresponding high resolution images.
The aim was to design a network for single image super-resolution that achieved
improvement of efficiency measured according to several metrics including
runtime, parameters, FLOPs, activations, and memory consumption while at least
maintaining the PSNR of 29.00dB on DIV2K validation set. IMDN is set as the
baseline for efficiency measurement. The challenge had 3 tracks including the
main track (runtime), sub-track one (model complexity), and sub-track two
(overall performance). In the main track, the practical runtime performance of
the submissions was evaluated. The rank of the teams were determined directly
by the absolute value of the average runtime on the validation set and test
set. In sub-track one, the number of parameters and FLOPs were considered. And
the individual rankings of the two metrics were summed up to determine a final
ranking in this track. In sub-track two, all of the five metrics mentioned in
the description of the challenge including runtime, parameter count, FLOPs,
activations, and memory consumption were considered. Similar to sub-track one,
the rankings of five metrics were summed up to determine a final ranking. The
challenge had 303 registered participants, and 43 teams made valid submissions.
They gauge the state-of-the-art in efficient single image super-resolution."#Validation code of the baseline model is available at . Validation of all submitted models is available at

detections and appearance embeddings in one forward pass received much
attention and achieved state-of-the-art results on the Multi-Object Tracking
(MOT) benchmarks. However, their success depends on the availability of videos
that are fully annotated with tracking data, which is expensive and hard to
obtain. This can limit the model generalization. In comparison, the two-stage
approach, which performs detection and embedding separately, is slower but
easier to train as their data are easier to annotate. We propose to combine the
best of the two worlds through a data distillation approach. Specifically, we
use a teacher embedder, trained on Re-ID datasets, to generate pseudo
appearance embedding labels for the detection datasets. Then, we use the
augmented dataset to train a detector that is also capable of regressing these
pseudo-embeddings in a fully-convolutional fashion. Our proposed one-stage
solution matches the two-stage counterpart in quality but is 3 times faster.
Even though the teacher embedder has not seen any tracking data during
training, our proposed tracker achieves competitive performance with some
popular trackers (e.g. JDE) trained with fully labeled tracking data."#Workshop on Learning with Limited Labelled Data for Image and Video Understanding (L3D-IVU), CVPR2022 Workshop
computer science#computing research repository#computer vision and pattern recognition#NMR: Neural Manifold Representation for Autonomous Driving#Unnikrishnan R. Nair, Sarthak Sharma, Midhun S. Menon, Srikanth Vidapanakal#"Autonomous driving requires efficient reasoning about the Spatio-temporal
nature of the semantics of the scene. Recent approaches have successfully
amalgamated the traditional modular architecture of an autonomous driving stack
comprising perception, prediction, and planning in an end-to-end trainable
system. Such a system calls for a shared latent space embedding with
interpretable intermediate trainable projected representation. One such
successfully deployed representation is the Bird's-Eye View(BEV) representation
of the scene in ego-frame. However, a fundamental assumption for an undistorted
BEV is the local coplanarity of the world around the ego-vehicle. This
assumption is highly restrictive, as roads, in general, do have gradients. The
resulting distortions make path planning inefficient and incorrect. To overcome
this limitation, we propose Neural Manifold Representation (NMR), a
representation for the task of autonomous driving that learns to infer
semantics and predict way-points on a manifold over a finite horizon, centered
on the ego-vehicle. We do this using an iterative attention mechanism applied
on a latent high dimensional embedding of surround monocular images and partial
ego-vehicle state. This representation helps generate motion and behavior plans
consistent with and cognizant of the surface geometry. We propose a sampling
algorithm based on edge-adaptive coverage loss of BEV occupancy grid and
associated guidance flow field to generate the surface manifold while incurring
minimal computational overhead. We aim to test the efficacy of our approach on
CARLA and SYNTHIA-SF."#
computer science#computing research repository#computer vision and pattern recognition#RepSR: Training Efficient VGG-style Super-Resolution Networks with Structural Re-Parameterization and Batch Normalization#Xintao Wang, Chao Dong, Ying Shan#"This paper explores training efficient VGG-style super-resolution (SR)
networks with the structural re-parameterization technique. The general
pipeline of re-parameterization is to train networks with multi-branch topology
first, and then merge them into standard 3x3 convolutions for efficient
inference. In this work, we revisit those primary designs and investigate
essential components for re-parameterizing SR networks. First of all, we find
that batch normalization (BN) is important to bring training non-linearity and
improve the final performance. However, BN is typically ignored in SR, as it
usually degrades the performance and introduces unpleasant artifacts. We
carefully analyze the cause of BN issue and then propose a straightforward yet
effective solution. In particular, we first train SR networks with mini-batch
statistics as usual, and then switch to using population statistics at the
later training period. While we have successfully re-introduced BN into SR, we
further design a new re-parameterizable block tailored for SR, namely RepSR. It
consists of a clean residual path and two expand-and-squeeze convolution paths
with the modified BN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our simple RepSR
is capable of achieving superior performance to previous SR re-parameterization
methods among different model sizes. In addition, our RepSR can achieve a
better trade-off between performance and actual running time (throughput) than
previous SR methods. Codes will be available at

the desired target duration while maximally preserving natural video dynamics.
Our approach trains a neural network through self-supervision to recognize and
accurately localize temporally varying changes in the video playback speed. To
re-time videos, we 1. use the model to infer the slowness of individual video
frames, and 2. optimize the temporal frame sub-sampling to be consistent with
the model's slowness predictions. We demonstrate that this model can detect
playback speed variations more accurately while also being orders of magnitude
more efficient than prior approaches. Furthermore, we propose an optimization
for video re-timing that enables precise control over the target duration and
performs more robustly on longer videos than prior methods. We evaluate the
model quantitatively on artificially speed-up videos, through transfer to
action recognition, and qualitatively through user studies."#Accepted at the AI for Content Creation (AICC) workshop at CVPR 2022
computer science#computing research repository#computer vision and pattern recognition#Revisiting Random Channel Pruning for Neural Network Compression#Yawei Li, Kamil Adamczewski, Wen Li, Shuhang Gu, Radu Timofte, Luc Van Gool#"Channel (or 3D filter) pruning serves as an effective way to accelerate the
inference of neural networks. There has been a flurry of algorithms that try to
solve this practical problem, each being claimed effective in some ways. Yet, a
benchmark to compare those algorithms directly is lacking, mainly due to the
complexity of the algorithms and some custom settings such as the particular
network configuration or training procedure. A fair benchmark is important for
the further development of channel pruning.
Meanwhile, recent investigations reveal that the channel configurations
discovered by pruning algorithms are at least as important as the pre-trained
weights. This gives channel pruning a new role, namely searching the optimal
channel configuration. In this paper, we try to determine the channel
configuration of the pruned models by random search. The proposed approach
provides a new way to compare different methods, namely how well they behave
compared with random pruning. We show that this simple strategy works quite
well compared with other channel pruning methods. We also show that under this
setting, there are surprisingly no clear winners among different channel
importance evaluation methods, which then may tilt the research efforts into
advanced channel configuration searching methods."#Accepted to CVPR2022. Code will be released at \url{}

shown massive performance gains by pretraining transformer models for a variety
of natural language processing tasks. The follow-up research adapted similar
methods like masked image modeling in vision transformer and demonstrated
improvements in the image classification task. Such simple self-supervised
methods are not exhaustively studied for object detection transformers (DETR,
Deformable DETR) as their transformer encoder modules take input in the
convolutional neural network (CNN) extracted feature space rather than the
image space as in general vision transformers. However, the CNN feature maps
still maintain the spatial relationship and we utilize this property to design
self-supervised learning approaches to train the encoder of object detection
transformers in pretraining and multi-task learning settings. We explore common
self-supervised methods based on image reconstruction, masked image modeling
and jigsaw. Preliminary experiments in the iSAID dataset demonstrate faster
convergence of DETR in the initial epochs in both pretraining and multi-task
learning settings; nonetheless, similar improvement is not observed in the case
of multi-task learning with Deformable DETR. The code for our experiments with
DETR and Deformable DETR are available at

computer science#computing research repository#computer vision and pattern recognition#Face Detection on Mobile: Five Implementations and Analysis#Kostiantyn Khabarlak#"In many practical cases face detection on smartphones or other highly
portable devices is a necessity. Applications include mobile face access
control systems, driver status tracking, emotion recognition, etc. Mobile
devices have limited processing power and should have long-enough battery life
even with face detection application running. Thus, striking the right balance
between algorithm quality and complexity is crucial. In this work we adapt 5
algorithms to mobile. These algorithms are based on handcrafted or
neural-network-based features and include: Viola-Jones (Haar cascade), LBP,
HOG, MTCNN, BlazeFace. We analyze inference time of these algorithms on
different devices with different input image resolutions. We provide guidance,
which algorithms are the best fit for mobile face access control systems and
potentially other mobile applications. Interestingly, we note that cascaded
algorithms perform faster on scenes without faces, while BlazeFace is slower on
empty scenes. Exploiting this behavior might be useful in practice."#

intelligence technologies, human perception of real-world scenes is no longer
limited to the use of small Field of View (FoV) and low-dimensional scene
detection devices. Panoramic imaging emerges as the next generation of
innovative intelligent instruments for environmental perception and
measurement. However, while satisfying the need for large-FoV photographic
imaging, panoramic imaging instruments are expected to have high resolution, no
blind area, miniaturization, and multi-dimensional intelligent perception, and
can be combined with artificial intelligence methods towards the next
generation of intelligent instruments, enabling deeper understanding and more
holistic perception of 360-degree real-world surrounding environments.
Fortunately, recent advances in freeform surfaces, thin-plate optics, and
metasurfaces provide innovative approaches to address human perception of the
environment, offering promising ideas beyond conventional optical imaging. In
this review, we begin with introducing the basic principles of panoramic
imaging systems, and then describe the architectures, features, and functions
of various panoramic imaging systems. Afterwards, we discuss in detail the
broad application prospects and great design potential of freeform surfaces,
thin-plate optics, and metasurfaces in panoramic imaging. We then provide a
detailed analysis on how these techniques can help enhance the performance of
panoramic imaging systems. We further offer a detailed analysis of applications
of panoramic imaging in scene understanding for autonomous driving and
robotics, spanning panoramic semantic image segmentation, panoramic depth
estimation, panoramic visual localization, and so on. Finally, we cast a
perspective on future potential and research directions for panoramic imaging
instruments."#29 pages, 14 figures, 348 references

is a challenging research topic relevant for extended reality, robotics and
virtual avatar generation. Due to the inherent depth ambiguity of monocular
settings, 3D motions captured with existing methods often contain severe
artefacts such as incorrect body-scene inter-penetrations, jitter and body
floating. To tackle these issues, we propose HULC, a new approach for 3D human
MoCap which is aware of the scene geometry. HULC estimates 3D poses and dense
body-environment surface contacts for improved 3D localisations, as well as the
absolute scale of the subject. Furthermore, we introduce a 3D pose trajectory
optimisation based on a novel pose manifold sampling that resolves erroneous
body-environment inter-penetrations. Although the proposed method requires less
structured inputs compared to existing scene-aware monocular MoCap algorithms,
it produces more physically-plausible poses: HULC significantly and
consistently outperforms the existing approaches in various experiments and on
different metrics."#

Tenenbaum, Wojciech Matusik, Chuang Gan#"This work considers identifying parameters characterizing a physical system's
dynamic motion directly from a video whose rendering configurations are
inaccessible. Existing solutions require massive training data or lack
generalizability to unknown rendering configurations. We propose a novel
approach that marries domain randomization and differentiable rendering
gradients to address this problem. Our core idea is to train a
rendering-invariant state-prediction (RISP) network that transforms image
differences into state differences independent of rendering configurations,
e.g., lighting, shadows, or material reflectance. To train this predictor, we
formulate a new loss on rendering variances using gradients from differentiable
rendering. Moreover, we present an efficient, second-order method to compute
the gradients of this loss, allowing it to be integrated seamlessly into modern
deep learning frameworks. We evaluate our method in rigid-body and
deformable-body simulation environments using four tasks: state estimation,
system identification, imitation learning, and visuomotor control. We further
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a real-world example: inferring the
state and action sequences of a quadrotor from a video of its motion sequences.
Compared with existing methods, our approach achieves significantly lower
reconstruction errors and has better generalizability among unknown rendering
configurations."#ICLR Oral. Project page:

information, such as color and texture. They are highly and widely used in
tasks such as segmentation. On the other hand, in indoor person segmentation,
it is necessary to collect person data considering privacy. We propose a new
task for human segmentation from invisible information, especially airborne
ultrasound. We first convert ultrasound waves to reflected ultrasound
directional images (ultrasound images) to perform segmentation from invisible
information. Although ultrasound images can roughly identify a person's
location, the detailed shape is ambiguous. To address this problem, we propose
a collaborative learning probabilistic U-Net that uses ultrasound and
segmentation images simultaneously during training, closing the probabilistic
distributions between ultrasound and segmentation images by comparing the
parameters of the latent spaces. In inference, only ultrasound images can be
used to obtain segmentation results. As a result of performance verification,
the proposed method could estimate human segmentations more accurately than
conventional probabilistic U-Net and other variational autoencoder models."#arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with

and variety, e.g, various scales, random rotations, and curve shapes. In this
paper, we propose an arbitrary shape text detector with a boundary transformer,
which can accurately and directly locate text boundaries without any
post-processing. Our method mainly consists of a boundary proposal module and
an iteratively optimized boundary transformer module. The boundary proposal
module consisting of multi-layer dilated convolutions will compute important
prior information (including classification map, distance field, and direction
field) for generating coarse boundary proposals meanwhile guiding the
optimization of boundary transformer. The boundary transformer module adopts an
encoder-decoder structure, in which the encoder is constructed by multi-layer
transformer blocks with residual connection while the decoder is a simple
multi-layer perceptron network (MLP). Under the guidance of prior information,
the boundary transformer module will gradually refine the coarse boundary
proposals via boundary deformation in an iterative manner. Furthermore, we
propose a novel boundary energy loss (BEL) which introduces an energy
minimization constraint and an energy monotonically decreasing constraint for
every boundary optimization step. Extensive experiments on publicly available
and challenging datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and
promising efficiency of our method."#13 pages, 12  is not the final version,just a preview. arXiv admin note: text overlap with

remote sensing community. With massive High-resolution Remote Sensing (HRS)
images available, manually and automatically designed Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) have already shown their great latent capacity on HRS
land-cover classification in recent years. Especially, the former can achieve
better performance while the latter is able to generate lightweight
architecture. Unfortunately, they both have shortcomings. On the one hand,
because manual CNNs are almost proposed for natural image processing, it
becomes very redundant and inefficient to process HRS images. On the other
hand, nascent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques for dense prediction
tasks are mainly based on encoder-decoder architecture, and just focus on the
automatic design of the encoder, which makes it still difficult to recover the
refined mapping when confronting complicated HRS scenes.
To overcome their defects and tackle the HRS land-cover classification
problems better, we propose AutoLC which combines the advantages of two
methods. First, we devise a hierarchical search space and gain the lightweight
encoder underlying gradient-based search strategy. Second, we meticulously
design a lightweight but top-performing decoder that is adaptive to the
searched encoder of itself. Finally, experimental results on the LoveDA
land-cover dataset demonstrate that our AutoLC method outperforms the
state-of-art manual and automatic methods with much less computational

learn complex maritime patterns from historical Automatic Identification System

applications, reliably quantifying the prediction uncertainty can be as
important as obtaining high accuracy. This paper extends deep learning
frameworks for trajectory prediction tasks by exploring how recurrent
encoder-decoder neural networks can be tasked not only to predict but also to
yield a corresponding prediction uncertainty via Bayesian modeling of epistemic
and aleatoric uncertainties. We compare the prediction performance of two
different models based on labeled or unlabeled input data to highlight how
uncertainty quantification and accuracy can be improved by using, if available,
additional information on the intention of the ship (e.g., its planned

assistance systems for autonomous vehicles. One of the most complex detection
challenges is that of partial occlusion, where a target object is only
partially available to the sensor due to obstruction by another foreground
object. A number of current pedestrian detection benchmarks provide annotation
for partial occlusion to assess algorithm performance in these scenarios,
however each benchmark varies greatly in their definition of the occurrence and
severity of occlusion. In addition, current occlusion level annotation methods
contain a high degree of subjectivity by the human annotator. This can lead to
inaccurate or inconsistent reporting of an algorithm's detection performance
for partially occluded pedestrians, depending on which benchmark is used. This
research presents a novel, objective method for pedestrian occlusion level
classification for ground truth annotation. Occlusion level classification is
achieved through the identification of visible pedestrian keypoints and through
the use of a novel, effective method of 2D body surface area estimation.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reflects the
pixel-wise occlusion level of pedestrians in images and is effective for all
forms of occlusion, including challenging edge cases such as self-occlusion,
truncation and inter-occluding pedestrians."#
computer science#computing research repository#computer vision and pattern recognition#Multi-Label Logo Recognition and Retrieval based on Weighted Fusion of Neural Features#Marisa Bernabeu, Antonio Javier Gallego, Antonio Pertusa#"Logo classification is a particular case of image classification, since these
may contain only text, images, or a combination of both. In this work, we
propose a system for the multi-label classification and similarity search of
logo images. The method allows obtaining the most similar logos on the basis of
their shape, color, business sector, semantics, general characteristics, or a
combination of such features established by the user. This is done by employing
a set of multi-label networks specialized in certain characteristics of logos.
The features extracted from these networks are combined to perform the
similarity search according to the search criteria established. Since the text
of logos is sometimes irrelevant for the classification, a preprocessing stage
is carried out to remove it, thus improving the overall performance. The
proposed approach is evaluated using the European Union Trademark (EUTM)
dataset, structured with the hierarchical Vienna classification system, which
includes a series of metadata with which to index trademarks. We also make a
comparison between well known logo topologies and Vienna in order to help
designers understand their correspondences. The experimentation carried out
attained reliable performance results, both quantitatively and qualitatively,
which outperformed the state-of-the-art results. In addition, since the
semantics and classification of brands can often be subjective, we also
surveyed graphic design students and professionals in order to assess the

typically performed manually by qualified engineers or inspectors. This task of
inspection is laborious, slow, and often requires complex access. Recently,
deep learning based algorithms have revealed promise and performance in the
automatic detection of corrosion. However, to date, research regarding the
segmentation of images for automated corrosion detection has been limited, due
to the lack of availability of per-pixel labelled data sets which are required
for model training. Herein, a novel deep learning approach (termed RustSEG) is
presented, that can accurately segment images for automated corrosion
detection, without the requirement of per-pixel labelled data sets for
training. The RustSEG method will first, using deep learning techniques,
determine if corrosion is present in an image (i.e. a classification task), and
then if corrosion is present, the model will examine what pixels in the
original image contributed to that classification decision. Finally, the method
can refine its predictions into a pixel-level segmentation mask. In ideal
cases, the method is able to generate precise masks of corrosion in images,
demonstrating that the automated segmentation of corrosion without per-pixel
training data is possible, addressing a significant hurdle in automated
infrastructure inspection."#

generative models. The suggested CDDB designs multiple evaluations on the
detection over easy, hard, and long sequence of deepfake tasks, with a set of
appropriate measures. In addition, we exploit multiple approaches to adapt
multiclass incremental learning methods, commonly used in the continual visual
recognition, to the continual deepfake detection problem. We evaluate several
methods, including the adapted ones, on the proposed CDDB. Within the proposed
benchmark, we explore some commonly known essentials of standard continual

by ACME~(Adversarial Cross-Modal Embedding) and H-T~(Hierarchical Transformer).
TNLBT aims to accomplish retrieval tasks while generating images from recipe

the Vision Transformer~(ViT)-based recipe image encoder, and an adversarial
network architecture to enable better cross-modal embedding learning for recipe
texts and images. In addition, we use self-supervised learning to exploit the
rich information in the recipe texts having no corresponding images. Since
contrastive learning could benefit from a larger batch size according to the
recent literature on self-supervised learning, we adopt a large batch size
during training and have validated its effectiveness. In the experiments, the
proposed framework significantly outperformed the current state-of-the-art
frameworks in both cross-modal recipe retrieval and image generation tasks on

spatial encodings and multi-view geometric consistency to reduce spatial
ambiguity. However, global encodings often suffer from overfitting to the
distribution of the training data, and it is difficult to learn multi-view
consistent reconstruction from sparse views. In this work, we investigate
common issues with existing spatial encodings and propose a simple yet highly
effective approach to modeling high-fidelity volumetric avatars from sparse
views. One of the key ideas is to encode relative spatial 3D information via
sparse 3D keypoints. This approach is robust to the sparsity of viewpoints and
cross-dataset domain gap. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for
head reconstruction. On human body reconstruction for unseen subjects, we also
achieve performance comparable to prior work that uses a parametric human body
model and temporal feature aggregation. Our experiments show that a majority of
errors in prior work stem from an inappropriate choice of spatial encoding and
thus we suggest a new direction for high-fidelity image-based avatar modeling."#The project page is available at

land cover classification and mapping that can constrain research and
stewardship efforts. In the US Northeast, emergence of low-statured woody
vegetation, or 'shrublands', instead of secondary forests in post-agricultural
landscapes is well-documented by field studies, but poorly understood from a
landscape perspective, which limits the ability to systematically study and
manage these lands. Objectives: To address gaps in classification/mapping of
low-statured cover types where they have been historically rare, we developed
models to predict 'shrubland' distributions at 30m resolution across New York
State (NYS), using machine learning and model ensembling techniques to
integrate remote sensing of structural (airborne LIDAR) and optical (satellite
imagery) properties of vegetation cover. We first classified a 1m canopy height
model (CHM), derived from a ""patchwork"" of available LIDAR coverages, to define
shrubland presence/absence. Next, these non-contiguous maps were used to train
a model ensemble based on temporally-segmented imagery to predict 'shrubland'
probability for the entire study landscape (NYS). Results: Approximately 2.5%
of the CHM coverage area was classified as shrubland. Models using Landsat
predictors trained on the classified CHM were effective at identifying
shrubland (test set AUC=0.893, real-world AUC=0.904), in discriminating between
shrub/young forest and other cover classes, and produced qualitatively sensible
maps, even when extending beyond the original training data. Conclusions: After
ground-truthing, we expect these shrubland maps and models will have many
research and stewardship applications including wildlife conservation, invasive
species mitigation and natural climate solutions."#29 pages (19 main text, 10 supplementary materials); 11 figures (10 main text, 1 supplementary materials), 10 tables (3 main text, 7 supplementary materials). Submitted to Landscape Ecology

controlling coefficients, which determine the restoration strength. Existing
methods are restricted in learning the controllable functions under the
supervision of known degradation types and levels. They usually suffer from a
severe performance drop when the real degradation is different from their
assumptions. Such a limitation is due to the complexity of real-world
degradations, which can not provide explicit supervision to the interactive
modulation during training. However, how to realize the interactive modulation
in real-world super-resolution has not yet been studied. In this work, we
present a Metric Learning based Interactive Modulation for Real-World
Super-Resolution (MM-RealSR). Specifically, we propose an unsupervised
degradation estimation strategy to estimate the degradation level in real-world
scenarios. Instead of using known degradation levels as explicit supervision to
the interactive mechanism, we propose a metric learning strategy to map the
unquantifiable degradation levels in real-world scenarios to a metric space,
which is trained in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, we introduce an anchor
point strategy in the metric learning process to normalize the distribution of
metric space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MM-RealSR

(excess-of-zeros data). A popular model for such data is the Hurdle model,
which explicitly models the probability of a zero count, while assuming a
sampling distribution on the positive integers. We consider data from multiple
count processes. In this context, it is of interest to study the patterns of
counts and cluster the subjects accordingly. We introduce a novel Bayesian
nonparametric approach to cluster multiple, possibly related, zero-inflated
processes. We propose a joint model for zero-inflated counts, specifying a
Hurdle model for each process with a shifted Negative Binomial sampling
distribution. Conditionally on the model parameters, the different processes
are assumed independent, leading to a substantial reduction in the number of
parameters as compared to traditional multivariate approaches. The
subject-specific probabilities of zero-inflation and the parameters of the
sampling distribution are flexibly modelled via an enriched finite mixture with
random number of components. This induces a two-level clustering of the
subjects based on the zero/non-zero patterns (outer clustering) and on the
sampling distribution (inner clustering). Posterior inference is performed
through tailored MCMC schemes. We demonstrate the proposed approach on an
application involving the use of the messaging service WhatsApp."#

to identify a model that is both interpretable and predictive. However, popular

This paper proposes a simple, yet powerful cross-validation strategy based on
maximizing squared correlations between the observed and predicted values,
rather than minimizing squared error loss. The strategy can be applied to all
penalized least-squares estimators and we show that, under certain conditions,
the metric implicitly performs a bias adjustment. Specific attention is given
to the lasso estimator, in which our strategy is closely related to the relaxed

is often a genuine need for dimension reduction to facilitate data
visualization and downstream statistical analysis. We propose Principal
Amalgamation Analysis (PAA), a novel amalgamation-based and taxonomy-guided
dimension reduction paradigm for microbiome data. Our approach aims to
aggregate the compositions into a smaller number of principal compositions,
guided by the available taxonomic structure, by minimizing a properly measured
loss of information. The choice of the loss function is flexible and can be
based on familiar diversity indices for preserving either within-sample or
between-sample diversity in the data. To enable scalable computation, we
develop a hierarchical PAA algorithm to trace the entire trajectory of
successive simple amalgamations. Visualization tools including dendrogram,
scree plot, and ordination plot are developed. The effectiveness of PAA is
demonstrated using gut microbiome data from a preterm infant study and an HIV

imbalances between treatment arms and increase statistical efficiency in
individually-randomized trials, analytical methods for covariate adjustment in
small CRTs have received little attention to date. In this paper, we
systematically investigate, through extensive simulations, the operating
characteristics of propensity score weighting and multivariable regression as
two covariate adjustment strategies for estimating the participant-average
causal effect in small CRTs with a rare binary outcome and identify scenarios
where each covariate adjustment strategy has a relative efficiency advantage
over the other to make practical recommendations. Beyond efficiency
considerations, we also examined the finite-sample performance of the sandwich
variance estimators associated with propensity score weighting and
multivariable regression for quantifying the uncertainty in estimating the
participant-average treatment effect. We found that the \citet{mancl2001} type
bias-corrected sandwich variance estimator tends to provide the closest to
nominal coverage for both propensity score weighting and multivariable
regression estimators, extending the existing recommendations for unadjusted
analysis of CRTs to accommodate covariate adjustment in small CRTs with a rare

adjustment approaches, we reanalyzed a recent CRT testing a sedation protocol

to the small number of observations that are usually available in applications.
When repeated extreme measurements are collected on the same individuals, i.e.,
a panel of extremes is available, pooling the observations in groups can
improve the statistical inference. We study three data sets related to risk
assessment in finance, climate science, and hydrology. In all three cases, the
problem can be formulated as an extreme value panel regression model with a
latent group structure and group-specific parameters. We propose a new
algorithm that jointly assigns the individuals to the latent groups and

efficiently recovers the underlying group structure without prior information,

high-dimensional system using an annealing machine. The sensor points are
calculated as a maximum clique problem of the graph, the edge weight of which
is determined by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) mode obtained from
data based on the fact that a high-dimensional system usually has a
low-dimensional representation. Since the maximum clique problem is equivalent
to the independent set problem of the complement graph, the independent set
problem is solved using Fujitsu Digital Annealer. As a demonstration of the
proposed method, the pressure distribution induced by the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n vortex
street behind a square cylinder is reconstructed based on the pressure data at
the calculated sensor points. The pressure distribution is measured by
pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) technique, which is an optical flow diagnose
method. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the pressure measured by
pressure transducer and the reconstructed pressures (calculated from the
proposed method and an existing greedy method) at the same place are compared.
As the result, the similar RMSE is achieved by the proposed method using
approximately 1/5 number of sensor points obtained by the existing method. This
method is of great importance as a novel approach for optimal sensor placement
problem and a new engineering application of an annealing machine."#

model the relationship of event occurrences between different phenomena.
Although the Hawkes process was originally introduced to describe excitation
interactions, which means that one event increases the chances of another
occurring, there has been a growing interest in modeling the opposite effect,
known as inhibition. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood approach to
estimate the interaction functions of a multivariate Hawkes process that can
account for both exciting and inhibiting effects. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first exact inference procedure designed for such a general setting
in the frequentist framework. Our method includes a thresholding step in order
to recover the support of interactions and therefore to infer the connectivity
graph. A benefit of our method is to provide an explicit computation of the
log-likelihood, which enables in addition to perform a goodness-of-fit test for
assessing the quality of estimations. We compare our method to classical
approaches, which were developed in the linear framework and are not
specifically designed for handling inhibiting effects. We show that the
proposed estimator performs better on synthetic data than alternative
approaches. We also illustrate the application of our procedure to a neuronal

associations in complex ecosystems. Based on the existing literature, we
provide an easy to implement fitting procedure as well as a technique to make

the point process is locally stable, which allows us to use the well-known
`coupling from the past' algorithm to draw samples from the model. Different

is supposed to work for products of non-flat geometry. The solution is based on
conducting hypothesis testing on the bearing area curves from two consecutive
stages of a surface finishing process. In each stage, the bearing area curves,
which are in fact the nonparametric quantile curves representing the surface
roughness, are extracted from surface profile measurements at a number of
sampling locations on the surface of the products. The hypothesis test of these
curves informs the decision makers whether there is a change in surface quality
induced by the current finishing action. When such change is detected, the
current action is deemed effective and should thus continue, while when no
change is detected, the effectiveness of the current action is then called into
question, signaling possibly some change in the course of action. Application

MCMC methods, notably structure MCMC, to sample graphs from the posterior

scored as a whole to improve the chain's convergence. Current examples of
algorithms taking advantage of grouping are the biased order MCMC, which acts
on the alternative space of permuted triangular matrices, and non ergodic edge

assess the plausibility of any exogeneity assumption by studying the
distributions of treatment given the unobservables that are consistent with
that assumption. We use this approach to study two common exogeneity
assumptions: quantile and mean independence. We show that both assumptions
require a kind of non-monotonic relationship between treatment and the

treatment selection. We also show how to define a new and weaker version of
quantile independence that allows for monotonic treatment selection. We then

based pedestrian detection functions. Besides 2D and 3D human pose, it also
supports body and head orientation estimation based on full body bounding box
input. This eliminates the need for explicit face recognition. We show that the
performance of 3D human pose estimation and orientation estimation is
comparable to the state-of-the-art. Since very few data sets exist for 3D human

destination of Video Question Answering (VideoQA).The major stumbling block to
achieve this purpose is the semantic gap between language and video since they
are at different levels of abstraction. Existing efforts mainly focus on
designing sophisticated architectures while utilizing frame- or object-level
visual representations. In this paper, we reconsider the multi-modal alignment
problem in VideoQA from feature and sample perspectives to achieve better
performance. From the view of feature,we break down the video into trajectories
and first leverage trajectory feature in VideoQA to enhance the alignment
between two modalities. Moreover, we adopt a heterogeneous graph architecture
and design a hierarchical framework to align both trajectory-level and
frame-level visual feature with language feature. In addition, we found that
VideoQA models are largely dependent on language priors and always neglect
visual-language interactions. Thus, two effective yet portable training
augmentation strategies are designed to strengthen the cross-modal
correspondence ability of our model from the view of sample. Extensive results
show that our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art models on the
challenging NExT-QA benchmark, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed method."#

which aims to recognize all events belonging to each modality and localize
their temporal boundaries. This task is challenging because only overall labels
indicating the video events are provided for training. However, an event might
be labeled but not appear in one of the modalities, which results in a
modality-specific noisy label problem. Motivated by two observations that
networks tend to learn clean samples first and that a labeled event would
appear in at least one modality, we propose a training strategy to identify and
remove modality-specific noisy labels dynamically. Specifically, we sort the
losses of all instances within a mini-batch individually in each modality, then
select noisy samples according to relationships between intra-modal and
inter-modal losses. Besides, we also propose a simple but valid noise ratio
estimation method by calculating the proportion of instances whose confidence
is below a preset threshold. Our method makes large improvements over the
previous state of the arts (e.g., from 60.0% to 63.8% in segment-level visual
metric), which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach."#

challenging task for visual scene understanding. Due to its low cost and high
efficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising
application prospects. However, accurately detecting objects through
perspective views in the 3D space is extremely difficult due to the lack of
depth information. Recently, DETR3D introduces a novel 3D-2D query paradigm in
aggregating multi-view images for 3D object detection and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, with intensive pilot experiments,
we quantify the objects located at different regions and find that the
""truncated instances"" (i.e., at the border regions of each image) are the main
bottleneck hindering the performance of DETR3D. Although it merges multiple
features from two adjacent views in the overlapping regions, DETR3D still
suffers from insufficient feature aggregation, thus missing the chance to fully
boost the detection performance. In an effort to tackle the problem, we propose
Graph-DETR3D to automatically aggregate multi-view imagery information through
graph structure learning (GSL). It constructs a dynamic 3D graph between each
object query and 2D feature maps to enhance the object representations,
especially at the border regions. Besides, Graph-DETR3D benefits from a novel
depth-invariant multi-scale training strategy, which maintains the visual depth
consistency by simultaneously scaling the image size and the object depth.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our Graph-DETR3D. Notably, our best model achieves 49.5 NDS on
the nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-art in comparison
with various published image-view 3D object detectors."#

increasing road safety. For this purpose, humans intuitively use visual cues,
such as light cones and light reflections emitted by other road users to be
able to react to oncoming traffic at an early stage. This behavior can be
imitated by computer vision methods by predicting the appearance of vehicles
based on emitted light reflections caused by the vehicle's headlights. Since
current object detection algorithms are mainly based on detecting directly
visible objects annotated via bounding boxes, the detection and annotation of
light reflections without sharp boundaries is challenging. For this reason, the
extensive open-source dataset PVDN (Provident Vehicle Detection at Night) was
published, which includes traffic scenarios at night with light reflections
annotated via keypoints. In this paper, we explore the potential of
saliency-based approaches to create different object representations based on
the visual saliency and sparse keypoint annotations of the PVDN dataset. For
that, we extend the general idea of Boolean map saliency towards a
context-aware approach by taking into consideration sparse keypoint annotations
by humans. We show that this approach allows for an automated derivation of
different object representations, such as binary maps or bounding boxes so that
detection models can be trained on different annotation variants and the
problem of providently detecting vehicles at night can be tackled from
different perspectives. With that, we provide further powerful tools and
methods to study the problem of detecting vehicles at night before they are
actually visible."#

architecture. Inferring accurate trajectories is nevertheless challenging, due
to the inherently uncertain nature of the future. To overcome these
difficulties, recent models use different inputs and propose to model human
intentions using complex fusion mechanisms. In this respect, we propose a
lightweight attention-based recurrent backbone that acts solely on past
observed positions. Although this backbone already provides promising results,
we demonstrate that its prediction accuracy can be improved considerably when
combined with a scene-aware goal-estimation module. To this end, we employ a
common goal module, based on a U-Net architecture, which additionally extracts
semantic information to predict scene-compliant destinations. We conduct
extensive experiments on publicly-available datasets (i.e. SDD, inD, ETH/UCY)

with the advent of deep learning techniques and emerging large-scale autonomous
driving datasets. However, drastic performance degradation remains an
unwell-studied challenge for practical cross-domain deployment as the lack of
labels on the target domain. In this paper, we first comprehensively
investigate the significant underlying factor of the domain gap in Mono3D,
where the critical observation is a depth-shift issue caused by the geometric
misalignment of domains. Then, we propose STMono3D, a new self-teaching
framework for unsupervised domain adaptation on Mono3D. To mitigate the
depth-shift, we introduce the geometry-aligned multi-scale training strategy to
disentangle the camera parameters and guarantee the geometry consistency of
domains. Based on this, we develop a teacher-student paradigm to generate
adaptive pseudo labels on the target domain. Benefiting from the end-to-end
framework that provides richer information of the pseudo labels, we propose the
quality-aware supervision strategy to take instance-level pseudo confidences
into account and improve the effectiveness of the target-domain training
process. Moreover, the positive focusing training strategy and dynamic
threshold are proposed to handle tremendous FN and FP pseudo samples. STMono3D
achieves remarkable performance on all evaluated datasets and even surpasses
fully supervised results on the KITTI 3D object detection dataset. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore effective UDA methods for
Mono3D."#

while following existing domain adaptation strategies. However, we argue that
it is critical to consider not only query selection criteria but also domain
adaptation strategies designed for ADA scenarios. This paper introduces
sequential learning considering both domain type (source/target) or labelness
(labeled/unlabeled). We first train our model only on labeled target samples
obtained by loss-based query selection. When loss-based query selection is
applied under domain shift, unuseful high-loss samples gradually increase, and
the labeled-sample diversity becomes low. To solve these, we fully utilize
pseudo labels of the unlabeled target domain by leveraging loss prediction. We
further encourage pseudo labels to have low self-entropy and diverse class
distributions. Our model significantly outperforms previous methods as well as

to handle, from varying lighting conditions to many cities around the world. In
this context, UDAs with several domains increase the challenges with the
addition of distribution shifts within the different target domains. This work
focuses on a novel framework for learning UDA, continuous UDA, in which models
operate on multiple target domains discovered sequentially, without access to
previous target domains. We propose MuHDi, for Multi-Head Distillation, a
method that solves the catastrophic forgetting problem, inherent in continual

algorithms (e.g., iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA)) as deep
neural networks (DNNs) with learnable parameters. However, existing ISTA-based
unfolded algorithms restrict the network architectures for iterative updates
with the partial weight coupling structure to guarantee convergence. In this
paper, we propose hybrid ISTA to unfold ISTA with both pre-computed and learned
parameters by incorporating free-form DNNs (i.e., DNNs with arbitrary feasible
and reasonable network architectures), while ensuring theoretical convergence.
We first develop HCISTA to improve the efficiency and flexibility of classical
ISTA (with pre-computed parameters) without compromising the convergence rate
in theory. Furthermore, the DNN-based hybrid algorithm is generalized to
popular variants of learned ISTA, dubbed HLISTA, to enable a free architecture
of learned parameters with a guarantee of linear convergence. To our best
knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a convergence-provable framework
that enables free-form DNNs in ISTA-based unfolded algorithms. This framework
is general to endow arbitrary DNNs for solving linear inverse problems with
convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate that hybrid ISTA can
reduce the reconstruction error with an improved convergence rate in the tasks

an untrimmed video. Anchor-free methods have made remarkable progress which
mainly formulate TAD into two tasks: classification and localization using two
separate branches. This paper reveals the temporal misalignment between the two
tasks hindering further progress. To address this, we propose a new method that
gives insights into moment and region perspectives simultaneously to align the
two tasks by acquiring reliable proposal quality. For the moment perspective,
Boundary Evaluate Module (BEM) is designed which focuses on local appearance
and motion evolvement to estimate boundary quality and adopts a multi-scale
manner to deal with varied action durations. For the region perspective, we
introduce Region Evaluate Module (REM) which uses a new and efficient sampling
method for proposal feature representation containing more contextual
information compared with point feature to refine category score and proposal
boundary. The proposed Boundary Evaluate Module and Region Evaluate Module
(BREM) are generic, and they can be easily integrated with other anchor-free
TAD methods to achieve superior performance. In our experiments, BREM is
combined with two different frameworks and improves the performance on THUMOS14
by 3.6$\%$ and 1.0$\%$ respectively, reaching a new state-of-the-art (63.6$\%$

Using a progressive clustering module we adaptively divide keypoints into
different subgraphs to reduce redundant connectivity, and employ a
coarse-to-fine paradigm for mitigating miss-classification within images. Our

pose estimation from the first touch for known objects. Given the object
geometry, we learn a tailored perception model in simulation that estimates a
probability distribution over possible object poses given a tactile
observation. To do so, we simulate the contact shapes that a dense set of
object poses would produce on the sensor. Then, given a new contact shape
obtained from the sensor, we match it against the pre-computed set using an
object-specific embedding learned using contrastive learning. We obtain contact
shapes from the sensor with an object-agnostic calibration step that maps RGB
tactile observations to binary contact shapes. This mapping, which can be
reused across object and sensor instances, is the only step trained with real
sensor data. This results in a perception model that localizes objects from the
first real tactile observation. Importantly, it produces pose distributions and
can incorporate additional pose constraints coming from other perception
systems, contacts, or priors.
We provide quantitative results for 20 objects. Tac2Pose provides high
accuracy pose estimations from distinctive tactile observations while
regressing meaningful pose distributions to account for those contact shapes
that could result from different object poses. We also test Tac2Pose on object
models reconstructed from a 3D scanner, to evaluate the robustness to
uncertainty in the object model. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of
Tac2Pose compared with three baseline methods for tactile pose estimation:
directly regressing the object pose with a neural network, matching an observed
contact to a set of possible contacts using a standard classification neural
network, and direct pixel comparison of an observed contact with a set of
possible contacts.

this paper, we demonstrate that masked image modeling approaches can also
advance 3D medical images analysis in addition to natural images. We study how
masked image modeling strategies leverage performance from the viewpoints of 3D
medical image segmentation as a representative downstream task: i) when
compared to naive contrastive learning, masked image modeling approaches
accelerate the convergence of supervised training even faster (1.40$\times$)
and ultimately produce a higher dice score; ii) predicting raw voxel values
with a high masking ratio and a relatively smaller patch size is non-trivial
self-supervised pretext-task for medical images modeling; iii) a lightweight

scale of acquired 3D point clouds poses a challenge to the existing data
compression techniques. Although promising performance has been achieved in
static point cloud compression, it remains under-explored and challenging to
leverage temporal correlations within a point cloud sequence for effective
dynamic point cloud compression. In this paper, we study the attribute (e.g.,
color) compression of dynamic point clouds and present a learning-based
framework, termed 4DAC. To reduce temporal redundancy within data, we first
build the 3D motion estimation and motion compensation modules with deep neural
networks. Then, the attribute residuals produced by the motion compensation
component are encoded by the region adaptive hierarchical transform into
residual coefficients. In addition, we also propose a deep conditional entropy
model to estimate the probability distribution of the transformed coefficients,
by incorporating temporal context from consecutive point clouds and the motion

fields such as healthcare. However, acquiring human motion datasets is highly
time-consuming, challenging, and expensive. Hence, human motion synthesis is a
crucial research problem within deep learning and computer vision. We present a
novel method for controllable human motion synthesis by applying
attention-based probabilistic deep adversarial models with end-to-end training.
We show that we can generate synthetic human motion over both short- and

however, limited hardware resources on edge devices make these requirements

In this paper, we study 3D deep learning from the efficiency perspective. We
first systematically analyze the bottlenecks of previous 3D methods. We then
combine the best from point-based and voxel-based models together and propose a
novel hardware-efficient 3D primitive, Point-Voxel Convolution (PVConv). We
further enhance this primitive with the sparse convolution to make it more

free-viewpoint images of arbitrary human performers, only requiring a sparse
number of camera views as inputs and skirting per-case fine-tuning. The large
variation of geometry and appearance, caused by articulated body poses, shapes

challenges, we present a simple yet powerful framework, named Generalizable
Neural Performer (GNR), that learns a generalizable and robust neural body
representation over various geometry and appearance. Specifically, we compress
the light fields for novel view human rendering as conditional implicit neural
radiance fields from both geometry and appearance aspects. We first introduce
an Implicit Geometric Body Embedding strategy to enhance the robustness based
on both parametric 3D human body model and multi-view images hints. We further

(RL) methods have been introduced. The interest in deep model-based RL is not
surprising, given its many potential benefits, such as higher sample efficiency
and the potential for fast adaption to changes in the environment. However, we
demonstrate, using an improved version of the recently introduced Local Change
Adaptation (LoCA) setup, that well-known model-based methods such as PlaNet and
DreamerV2 perform poorly in their ability to adapt to local environmental
changes. Combined with prior work that made a similar observation about the
other popular model-based method, MuZero, a trend appears to emerge, suggesting
that current deep model-based methods have serious limitations. We dive deeper
into the causes of this poor performance, by identifying elements that hurt
adaptive behavior and linking these to underlying techniques frequently used in
deep model-based RL. We empirically validate these insights in the case of
linear function approximation by demonstrating that a modified version of
linear Dyna achieves effective adaptation to local changes. Furthermore, we
provide detailed insights into the challenges of building an adaptive nonlinear
model-based method, by experimenting with a nonlinear version of Dyna."#

such as delivery, military mission, disaster rescue, communication, etc., due
to its flexibility and versatility. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning method to solve the UAV online routing problem with wireless power
transfer, which can charge the UAV remotely without wires, thus extending the
capability of the battery-limited UAV. Our study considers the power
consumption of the UAV and the wireless charging process. Unlike the previous
works, we solve the problem by a designed deep neural network. The model is
trained using a deep reinforcement learning method offline, and is used to
optimize the UAV routing problem online. On small and large scale instances,
the proposed model runs from four times to 500 times faster than Google
OR-tools, the state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization solver, with
identical solution quality. It also outperforms different types of heuristic
and local search methods in terms of both run-time and optimality. In addition,
once the model is trained, it can scale to new generated problem instances with
arbitrary topology that are not seen during training. The proposed method is
practically applicable when the problem scale is large and the response time is
crucial."#

computer science#computing research repository#machine learning#Trusted Multi-View Classification with Dynamic Evidential Fusion#Zongbo Han, Changqing Zhang, Huazhu Fu, Joey Tianyi Zhou#"Existing multi-view classification algorithms focus on promoting accuracy by
exploiting different views, typically integrating them into common
representations for follow-up tasks. Although effective, it is also crucial to
ensure the reliability of both the multi-view integration and the final
decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and out-of-distribution data.
Dynamically assessing the trustworthiness of each view for different samples
could provide reliable integration. This can be achieved through uncertainty
estimation. With this in mind, we propose a novel multi-view classification
algorithm, termed trusted multi-view classification (TMC), providing a new
paradigm for multi-view learning by dynamically integrating different views at
an evidence level. The proposed TMC can promote classification reliability by
considering evidence from each view. Specifically, we introduce the variational
Dirichlet to characterize the distribution of the class probabilities,
parameterized with evidence from different views and integrated with the
Dempster-Shafer theory. The unified learning framework induces accurate
uncertainty and accordingly endows the model with both reliability and
robustness against possible noise or corruption. Both theoretical and
experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in
accuracy, robustness and trustworthiness."#
computer science#computing research repository#machine learning#Imitation Learning from Observations under Transition Model Disparity#Tanmay Gangwani, Yuan Zhou, Jian Peng#"Learning to perform tasks by leveraging a dataset of expert observations,
also known as imitation learning from observations (ILO), is an important
paradigm for learning skills without access to the expert reward function or
the expert actions. We consider ILO in the setting where the expert and the
learner agents operate in different environments, with the source of the
discrepancy being the transition dynamics model. Recent methods for scalable
ILO utilize adversarial learning to match the state-transition distributions of
the expert and the learner, an approach that becomes challenging when the
dynamics are dissimilar. In this work, we propose an algorithm that trains an
intermediary policy in the learner environment and uses it as a surrogate
expert for the learner. The intermediary policy is learned such that the state
transitions generated by it are close to the state transitions in the expert
dataset. To derive a practical and scalable algorithm, we employ concepts from
prior work on estimating the support of a probability distribution. Experiments
using MuJoCo locomotion tasks highlight that our method compares favorably to
the baselines for ILO with transition dynamics mismatch."#

models by defining equivalence classes of data samples related by
transformations. However, characterizing how transformations act on input data
is often difficult, limiting the applicability of equivariant models. We
propose learning symmetric embedding networks (SENs) that encode an input space
(e.g. images), where we do not know the effect of transformations (e.g.
rotations), to a feature space that transforms in a known manner under these
operations. This network can be trained end-to-end with an equivariant task
network to learn an explicitly symmetric representation. We validate this
approach in the context of equivariant transition models with 3 distinct forms
of symmetry. Our experiments demonstrate that SENs facilitate the application
of equivariant networks to data with complex symmetry representations.
Moreover, doing so can yield improvements in accuracy and generalization
relative to both fully-equivariant and non-equivariant baselines."#

linear measurements, a task that appears in a variety of problems in signal
processing, statistics, and machine learning. In this paper, we focus on the
Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method. While this algorithm has been studied
in a number of previous works, most of them only show convergence from an
initialization close to the true solution and thus require a carefully designed
initialization scheme. However, random initialization has often been preferred
by practitioners as it is model-agnostic. In this paper, we show that ALS with
random initialization converges to the true solution with
$\varepsilon$-accuracy in $O(\log n + \log (1/\varepsilon)) $ iterations using
only a near-optimal amount of samples, where we assume the measurement matrices
to be i.i.d. Gaussian and where by $n$ we denote the ambient dimension. Key to
our proof is the observation that the trajectory of the ALS iterates only
depends very mildly on certain entries of the random measurement matrices.
Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions."#

A User Study, Baseline, And  Dataset#Leon Sixt, Martin Schuessler, Oana-Iuliana Popescu, Philipp WeiÃŸ, Tim Landgraf#"A variety of methods exist to explain image classification models. However,
whether they provide any benefit to users over simply comparing various inputs

study (N=240) to test how such a baseline explanation technique performs
against concept-based and counterfactual explanations. To this end, we
contribute a synthetic dataset generator capable of biasing individual
attributes and quantifying their relevance to the model. In a study, we assess
if participants can identify the relevant set of attributes compared to the
ground-truth. Our results show that the baseline outperformed concept-based
explanations. Counterfactual explanations from an invertible neural network
performed similarly as the baseline. Still, they allowed users to identify some
attributes more accurately. Our results highlight the importance of measuring
how well users can reason about biases of a model, rather than solely relying

computer science#computing research repository#machine learning#Predicting Real-time Scientific Experiments Using Transformer models and  Reinforcement Learning#Juan Manuel Parrilla-Gutierrez#"Life and physical sciences have always been quick to adopt the latest
advances in machine learning to accelerate scientific discovery. Examples of
this are cell segmentation or cancer detection. Nevertheless, these exceptional
results are based on mining previously created datasets to discover patterns or
trends. Recent advances in AI have been demonstrated in real-time scenarios
like self-driving cars or playing video games. However, these new techniques
have not seen widespread adoption in life or physical sciences because
experimentation can be slow. To tackle this limitation, this work aims to adapt
generative learning algorithms to model scientific experiments and accelerate
their discovery using in-silico simulations. We particularly focused on
real-time experiments, aiming to model how they react to user inputs. To
achieve this, here we present an encoder-decoder architecture based on the
Transformer model to simulate real-time scientific experimentation, predict its
future behaviour and manipulate it on a step-by-step basis. As a proof of
concept, this architecture was trained to map a set of mechanical inputs to the
oscillations generated by a chemical reaction. The model was paired with a
Reinforcement Learning controller to show how the simulated chemistry can be
manipulated in real-time towards user-defined behaviours. Our results
demonstrate how generative learning can model real-time scientific
experimentation to track how it changes through time as the user manipulates
it, and how the trained models can be paired with optimisation algorithms to
discover new phenomena beyond the physical limitations of lab experimentation.
This work paves the way towards building surrogate systems where physical
experimentation interacts with machine learning on a step-by-step basis."#
computer science#computing research repository#machine learning#Online Deep Learning from Doubly-Streaming Data#Heng Lian, John Scovil Atwood, Bojian Hou, Jian Wu, Yi He#"This paper investigates a new online learning problem with doubly-streaming
data, where the data streams are described by feature spaces that constantly
evolve, with new features emerging and old features fading away. The challenges
of this problem are two folds: 1) Data samples ceaselessly flowing in may carry
shifted patterns over time, requiring learners to update hence adapt
on-the-fly. 2) Newly emerging features are described by very few samples,
resulting in weak learners that tend to make error predictions. A plausible
idea to overcome the challenges is to establish relationship between the
pre-and-post evolving feature spaces, so that an online learner can leverage
the knowledge learned from the old features to better the learning performance
on the new features. Unfortunately, this idea does not scale up to
high-dimensional media streams with complex feature interplay, which suffers an
tradeoff between onlineness (biasing shallow learners) and
expressiveness(requiring deep learners). Motivated by this, we propose a novel
OLD^3S paradigm, where a shared latent subspace is discovered to summarize
information from the old and new feature spaces, building intermediate feature
mapping relationship. A key trait of OLD^3S is to treat the model capacity as a
learnable semantics, yields optimal model depth and parameters jointly, in
accordance with the complexity and non-linearity of the input data streams in
an online fashion. Both theoretical analyses and empirical studies substantiate
the viability and effectiveness of our proposal."#
computer science#computing research repository#machine learning#Faculty Distillation with Optimal Transport#Su Lu, Han-Jia Ye, De-Chuan Zhan#"Knowledge distillation (KD) has shown its effectiveness in improving a
student classifier given a suitable teacher. The outpouring of diverse and
plentiful pre-trained models may provide abundant teacher resources for KD.
However, these models are often trained on different tasks from the student,
which requires the student to precisely select the most contributive teacher
and enable KD across different label spaces. These restrictions disclose the
insufficiency of standard KD and motivate us to study a new paradigm called
faculty distillation. Given a group of teachers (faculty), a student needs to
select the most relevant teacher and perform generalized knowledge reuse. To
this end, we propose to link teacher's task and student's task by optimal
transport. Based on the semantic relationship between their label spaces, we
can bridge the support gap between output distributions by minimizing Sinkhorn
distances. The transportation cost also acts as a measurement of teachers'
adaptability so that we can rank the teachers efficiently according to their
relatedness. Experiments under various settings demonstrate the succinctness
and versatility of our method."#
computer science#computing research repository#machine learning#Task-Induced Representation Learning#Jun Yamada, Karl Pertsch, Anisha Gunjal, Joseph J. Lim#"In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of representation learning
approaches for decision making in visually complex environments. Representation
learning is essential for effective reinforcement learning (RL) from
high-dimensional inputs. Unsupervised representation learning approaches based
on reconstruction, prediction or contrastive learning have shown substantial
learning efficiency gains. Yet, they have mostly been evaluated in clean
laboratory or simulated settings. In contrast, real environments are visually
complex and contain substantial amounts of clutter and distractors.
Unsupervised representations will learn to model such distractors, potentially
impairing the agent's learning efficiency. In contrast, an alternative class of
approaches, which we call task-induced representation learning, leverages task
information such as rewards or demonstrations from prior tasks to focus on
task-relevant parts of the scene and ignore distractors. We investigate the
effectiveness of unsupervised and task-induced representation learning
approaches on four visually complex environments, from Distracting DMControl to
the CARLA driving simulator. For both, RL and imitation learning, we find that
representation learning generally improves sample efficiency on unseen tasks
even in visually complex scenes and that task-induced representations can
double learning efficiency compared to unsupervised alternatives. Code is

computer science#computing research repository#machine learning#Algorithms and Theory for Supervised Gradual Domain Adaptation#Jing Dong, Shiji Zhou, Baoxiang Wang, Han Zhao#"The phenomenon of data distribution evolving over time has been observed in a
range of applications, calling the needs of adaptive learning algorithms. We
thus study the problem of supervised gradual domain adaptation, where labeled
data from shifting distributions are available to the learner along the
trajectory, and we aim to learn a classifier on a target data distribution of
interest. Under this setting, we provide the first generalization upper bound
on the learning error under mild assumptions. Our results are algorithm
agnostic, general for a range of loss functions, and only depend linearly on
the averaged learning error across the trajectory. This shows significant
improvement compared to the previous upper bound for unsupervised gradual
domain adaptation, where the learning error on the target domain depends
exponentially on the initial error on the source domain. Compared with the
offline setting of learning from multiple domains, our results also suggest the
potential benefits of the temporal structure among different domains in
adapting to the target one. Empirically, our theoretical results imply that
learning proper representations across the domains will effectively mitigate
the learning errors. Motivated by these theoretical insights, we propose a
min-max learning objective to learn the representation and classifier
simultaneously. Experimental results on both semi-synthetic and large-scale
real datasets corroborate our findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
objectives."#

To reduce the large design cost of these manual solutions, we discuss the
AutoML framework for each of them, such as neural architecture search (NAS) and
automated pruning and quantization. We then cover efficient on-device training

exploiting their spatial sparsity and temporal/token redundancy. Finally, to
support all these algorithmic advancements, we introduce the efficient deep

and ensure safe operation of machinery. A novel graph neural network-based
fault detection method is proposed to build a bridge between AI and real-world
running mechanical systems. First, the vibration signals, which are Euclidean
structured data, are converted into graph (non-Euclidean structured data), so
that the vibration signals, which are originally independent of each other, are
correlated with each other. Second, inputs the dataset together with its
corresponding graph into the GNN for training, which contains graphs in each
hidden layer of the network, enabling the graph neural network to learn the
feature values of itself and its neighbors, and the obtained early features
have stronger discriminability. Finally, determines the top-n objects that are
difficult to reconstruct in the output layer of the GNN as fault objects. A
public datasets of bearings have been used to verify the effectiveness of the

of prediction multiplicities from the view of explainable AI, global analysis
of a collection of all good models, also known as a `Rashomon set,' has been
attracted much attention for the last years. Since finding such a set of good
models is a hard computational problem, there have been only a few algorithms
for the problem so far, most of which are either approximate or incomplete. To
overcome this difficulty, we study efficient enumeration of all good models for
a subclass of interpretable models, called rule lists. Based on a
state-of-the-art optimal rule list learner, CORELS, proposed by Angelino et al.
in 2017, we present an efficient enumeration algorithm CorelsEnum for exactly
computing a set of all good models using polynomial space in input size, given
a dataset and a error tolerance from an optimal model. By experiments with the
COMPAS dataset on recidivism prediction, our algorithm CorelsEnum successfully
enumerated all of several tens of thousands of good rule lists of length at
most $\ell = 3$ in around 1,000 seconds, while a state-of-the-art top-$K$ rule
list learner based on Lawler's method combined with CORELS, proposed by Hara
and Ishihata in 2018, found only 40 models until the timeout of 6,000 seconds.
For global analysis, we conducted experiments for characterizing the Rashomon
set, and observed large diversity of models in predictive multiplicity and
fairness of models."#

Andrade, Lorena Santos, Alexandre Carvalho, Karine Ferreira#"The development of analytical software for big Earth observation data faces
several challenges. Designers need to balance between conflicting factors.
Solutions that are efficient for specific hardware architectures can not be
used in other environments. Packages that work on generic hardware and open
standards will not have the same performance as dedicated solutions. Software
that assumes that its users are computer programmers are flexible but may be
difficult to learn for a wide audience. This paper describes sits, an
open-source R package for satellite image time series analysis using machine
learning. To allow experts to use satellite imagery to the fullest extent, sits
adopts a time-first, space-later approach. It supports the complete cycle of
data analysis for land classification. Its API provides a simple but powerful
set of functions. The software works in different cloud computing environments.
Satellite image time series are input to machine learning classifiers, and the
results are post-processed using spatial smoothing. Since machine learning
methods need accurate training data, sits includes methods for quality
assessment of training samples. The software also provides methods for
validation and accuracy measurement. The package thus comprises a production
environment for big EO data analysis. We show that this approach produces high

computer science#computing research repository#machine learning#The Multiscale Structure of Neural Network Loss Functions: The Effect on  Optimization and Origin#Chao Ma, Lei Wu, Lexing Ying#"Local quadratic approximation has been extensively used to study the
optimization of neural network loss functions around the minimum. Though, it
usually holds in a very small neighborhood of the minimum, and cannot explain
many phenomena observed during the optimization process. In this work, we study
the structure of neural network loss functions and its implication on
optimization in a region beyond the reach of good quadratic approximation.
Numerically, we observe that neural network loss functions possesses a
multiscale structure, manifested in two ways: (1) in a neighborhood of minima,
the loss mixes a continuum of scales and grows subquadratically, and (2) in a
larger region, the loss shows several separate scales clearly. Using the
subquadratic growth, we are able to explain the Edge of Stability phenomenon[4]
observed for gradient descent (GD) method. Using the separate scales, we
explain the working mechanism of learning rate decay by simple examples.
Finally, we study the origin of the multiscale structure and propose that the
non-uniformity of training data is one of its cause. By constructing a
two-layer neural network problem we show that training data with different
magnitudes give rise to different scales of the loss function, producing
subquadratic growth or multiple separate scales."#

feedforward networks defined using any suitable activation function can
approximate any integrable function locally in $L^1$-norm. Though different
approximation rates are available for deep neural networks defined using other
classes of activation functions, there is little explanation for the
empirically confirmed advantage that ReLU networks exhibit over their classical
(e.g. sigmoidal) counterparts. Our main result demonstrates that deep networks
with piecewise linear activation (e.g. ReLU or PReLU) are fundamentally more
expressive than deep feedforward networks with analytic (e.g. sigmoid, Swish,
GeLU, or Softplus). More specifically, we construct a strict refinement of the
topology on the space $L^1_{\operatorname{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{R}^D)$ of
locally Lebesgue-integrable functions, in which the set of deep ReLU networks
with (bilinear) pooling $\operatorname{NN}^{\operatorname{ReLU} +

networks defined using any combination of analytic activation functions with
(or without) pooling layers $\operatorname{NN}^{\omega+\operatorname{Pool}}$ is
not dense (i.e. not universal). Our main result is further explained by
\textit{quantitatively} demonstrating that this ""separation phenomenon"" between
the networks in $\operatorname{NN}^{\operatorname{ReLU}+\operatorname{Pool}}$
and those in $\operatorname{NN}^{\omega+\operatorname{Pool}}$ by showing that
the networks in $\operatorname{NN}^{\operatorname{ReLU}}$ are capable of

certain inferences is as crucial as the accuracy of such inferences. Some ML
models like the decision tree possess inherent interpretability that can be
directly comprehended by humans. Others like artificial neural networks (ANN),
however, rely on external methods to uncover the deduction mechanism. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is one of such external methods, which requires a
background dataset when interpreting ANNs. Generally, a background dataset
consists of instances randomly sampled from the training dataset. However, the
sampling size and its effect on SHAP remain to be unexplored. In our empirical
study on the MIMIC-III dataset, we show that the two core explanations - SHAP
values and variable rankings fluctuate when using different background datasets
acquired from random sampling, indicating that users cannot unquestioningly
trust the one-shot interpretation from SHAP. Luckily, such fluctuation
decreases with the increase of the background dataset size. Also, we notice an
U-shape in the stability assessment of SHAP variable rankings, demonstrating
that SHAP is more reliable in ranking the most and least important variables
compared to moderately important ones. Overall, our results suggest that users
should take into account how background data affects SHAP results, with
improved SHAP stability as the background sample size increases."#

robot learning, their sample inefficiency makes the learning of complex,
long-horizon behaviors with real robot systems infeasible. To mitigate this
issue, meta-reinforcement learning methods aim to enable fast learning on novel
tasks by learning how to learn. Yet, the application has been limited to
short-horizon tasks with dense rewards. To enable learning long-horizon
behaviors, recent works have explored leveraging prior experience in the form
of offline datasets without reward or task annotations. While these approaches
yield improved sample efficiency, millions of interactions with environments
are still required to solve complex tasks. In this work, we devise a method
that enables meta-learning on long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks, allowing us to
solve unseen target tasks with orders of magnitude fewer environment
interactions. Our core idea is to leverage prior experience extracted from
offline datasets during meta-learning. Specifically, we propose to (1) extract
reusable skills and a skill prior from offline datasets, (2) meta-train a
high-level policy that learns to efficiently compose learned skills into
long-horizon behaviors, and (3) rapidly adapt the meta-trained policy to solve
an unseen target task. Experimental results on continuous control tasks in
navigation and manipulation demonstrate that the proposed method can
efficiently solve long-horizon novel target tasks by combining the strengths of
meta-learning and the usage of offline datasets, while prior approaches in RL,

attention extensively over the last decade. Most of such devices were proposed
for photonics and radiofrequency applications. In this work, we present a
unique technology of graphene-on-silicon heterostructures and their properties
as solution-gated transistors. The graphene-on-Silicon field-effect transistors
(GoSFETs) were fabricated exploiting various conformations of drain-source
regions doping and channel material dimensions. The fabricated devices were
electrically characterized demonstrating hybrid behavior with features specific
to both graphene and silicon. Although GoSFET's transconductance and carrier's
mobility were found to be lower than in conventional silicon and graphene
field-effect transistors (SiFETs and GFETs), it was demonstrated that the
combination of both materials within the hybrid channel contribute uniquely to
the charge carrier transport. A comprehensive physics-based compact modeling
was specifically developed, showing excellent agreement with the experimental
data. The model is employed to rationalize the observed hybrid behavior as the
theoretical results from the electrostatics and the carrier transport under a
drift-diffusion approach show that graphene acts as a shield for the silicon
channel, giving rise to a non-uniform potential distribution along it,
especially at the subthreshold region. This graphene screening effect is shown
to strongly affect the device subthreshold swing when compared against a
conventional SiFET due to a non-negligible diffusion current in this operation
regime."#

transfer in micro- and mini-channels with arrays of offset strip fins, subject
to a constant heat flux. The Nusselt number is defined on the basis of a heat
transfer coefficient which represents the spatially constant macro-scale
temperature difference between the fluid and solid during conjugate heat
transfer. Its values are determined numerically on a single unit cell of the
array for Reynolds numbers between 1 and 600. Two combinations of the Prandtl
number and the thermal conductivity ratio are selected, corresponding to air
and water. It is shown that the Nusselt number correlations from the literature
mainly apply to air in the transitional flow regime in larger conventional
channels if the wall temperature remains uniform. As a result, they do not
correctly capture the observed trends for the Nusselt number in micro- and
mini-channels subject to a constant heat flux. Therefore, new Nusselt number
correlations, obtained through a least-squares fitting of 2282 numerical
simulations, are presented for air and water. The suitability of these
correlations is assessed via the Bayesian approach for parameter estimation and
model validation. The correlations respect the observed asymptotic trends and
limits of the Nusselt number for all the geometrical parameters of the offset
strip fins. In addition, they predict a linear dependence of the Nusselt number
on the Reynolds number, in good agreement with the data from this work.
Nevertheless, a detailed analysis reveals a more complex scaling of the Nusselt
number with the Reynolds number, closely related to the underlying flow
regimes, particularly the weak and strong inertia regimes. Finally, through 62
additional simulations, the influence of the material properties on the Nusselt
number is illustrated and compared to the available literature."#

efficiency for wireless powering implantable bioelectric devices. Similarly,
many mathematical formulations have been proposed to evaluate the effect of
these mechanisms as well as predict this maximum efficiency and the
corresponding optimum frequency. However, most of these methods consider a
simplified model, and they cannot tackle some realistic aspects of implantable
wireless power transfer. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel approach that
can analyze the efficiency in anatomical models and provide insightful
information on achieving this optimum operation. First, this approach is
validated with a theoretical spherical wave expansion analysis, and the results
for a simplified spherical model and a bidimensional human pectoral model are
compared. Results have shown that even though a magnetic receiver outperforms
an electric one for near-field operation and both sources could be equally
employed in far-field range, it is in mid-field that the maximum efficiency is
achieved, with an optimum frequency between 1-5 GHz, depending on the
implantation depth. In addition, the receiver orientation is another factor
that affects the efficiency, with a maximum difference between the best and
worst-case scenarios around five times for an electric source and over 13 times
for the magnetic one. Finally, this approach is used to analyze the case of a
wirelessly powered deep-implanted pacemaker by an on-body transmitter and to
establish the parameters that lead to the maximum achievable efficiency."#

Tait, Adriana Lita, John Biesecker, Anna Fox, David Olaya, Richard P. Mirin, Sae Woo Nam, Jeffrey M. Shainline#"Superconducting optoelectronic hardware is being explored as a path towards
artificial spiking neural networks with unprecedented scales of complexity and
computational ability. Such hardware combines integrated-photonic components
for few-photon, light-speed communication with superconducting circuits for
fast, energy-efficient computation. Monolithic integration of superconducting
and photonic devices is necessary for the scaling of this technology. In the
present work, superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors are
monolithically integrated with Josephson junctions for the first time, enabling
the realization of superconducting optoelectronic synapses. We present circuits
that perform analog weighting and temporal leaky integration of single-photon
presynaptic signals. Synaptic weighting is implemented in the electronic domain
so that binary, single-photon communication can be maintained. Records of
recent synaptic activity are locally stored as current in superconducting
loops. Dendritic and neuronal nonlinearities are implemented with a second
stage of Josephson circuitry. The hardware presents great design flexibility,
with demonstrated synaptic time constants spanning four orders of magnitude
(hundreds of nanoseconds to milliseconds). The synapses are responsive to
presynaptic spike rates exceeding 10 MHz and consume approximately 33 aJ of
dynamic power per synapse event before accounting for cooling. In addition to
neuromorphic hardware, these circuits introduce new avenues towards realizing
large-scale single-photon-detector arrays for diverse imaging, sensing, and

physics#physics#applied physics#In situ nonlinear Rayleigh wave technique to characterize the tensile  plastic deformation of stainless steel 316L#Changgong Kim, Kathryn H. Matlack#"The acoustic nonlinearity parameter(beta) is sensitive to dislocation
parameters, which continuously change during plastic deformation.
Dislocation-based damage in structures/components is the source of the failure;
thus, beta has been studied as a metric for non-destructive evaluation. This
work consists of two parts: the development of an in situ experimental setup
for nonlinear Rayleigh wave measurements, and characterization of the
dependence of beta on applied stress at different levels of initial plastic
strain. First, we introduce an experimental setup and methods for repeatable in
situ nonlinear ultrasonic measurements. Details on design considerations and
measurement schemes are provided. In the second part, beta was measured in situ
during an incremental monotonic tensile test. The measured \beta monotonically
decreases with plastic strain, but it is relatively insensitive to the applied
stress during elastic deformation. This result highlights three aspects of the
evolution of beta, which have not been sufficiently emphasized in prior work:
the apparent insensitivity of beta to the applied stress during elastic
deformation, decreasing beta with plastic deformation, and the saturation of
beta. We attribute the trend of decreasing beta to a scaling of beta with
monopole loop length during plastic deformation, which depends on initial
microstructure. The saturation of beta at 1.8% coincides with a planar-to-wavy
transition of dislocation structures. The in situ nonlinear ultrasonic
experimental method presented in this work is significant as the in situ
results can provide broader insights on beta and dislocation-based damage
evolution than ex situ measurements alone."#
physics#physics#applied physics#Fiber-optic multimode interference sensing: comprehensive  characterization and its potential for strain-insensitive temperature sensing#Kun Wang, Yosuke Mizuno, Xingchen Dong, Wolfgang Kurz, Maximilian Fink, Heeyoung Lee, Martin Jakobi, Alexander W. Koch#"A strain-insensitive temperature sensor based on multimode interference using
standard multimode fibers (MMFs) is proposed according to the comprehensive
study of the characteristics of the MMFs. The temperature and strain
dependences on the core diameter, numerical aperture (NA), and the length of
the MMF section in the single-mode--multimode--single-mode (SMS) fiber
structure are investigated experimentally. The results indicate that the larger
core diameter of the MMF leads to higher temperature sensitivity but lower
strain sensitivity (absolute values); the higher NA does not influence the
temperature sensitivity but results in higher absolute value of strain
sensitivity; the longer MMF section brings lower temperature sensitivity but
does not have an impact on strain sensitivity. These findings also contribute
to the theoretical analysis of the length dependence in the SMS fiber sensors.
Besides, the results of the characterization study show that the strain
sensitivity is relatively low, which brings a possibility to develop a
strain-insensitive temperature sensor. The proposed sensor is used for
temperature sensing while the strain is constantly applied from 0 to 1100
$\mu\epsilon$ with steps of 100 $\mu\epsilon$. The measured results are
consistent with the comprehensive study. The mean temperature sensitivity is
6.14 pm/$^{\circ}$C with a standard deviation of 0.39 pm/$^{\circ}$C, which
proves that the proposed temperature sensor exhibits good stability and is
insensitive to strain. We expect that these results will provide a profound
guideline to fiber sensors based on multimode interference."#

Castellanos, Vincenzo Giannini, JosÃ© A. SÃ¡nchez-Gil, Katsuhisa Tanaka, Jaime GÃ³mez Rivas#"Various optical phenomena can be induced in periodic arrays of nanoparticles
by the radiative coupling of the local dipoles in each particle. Probably the
most impressive example is bound states in the continuum (BICs), which are
electromagnetic modes with a dispersion inside the light cone but infinite
lifetime, i.e., modes that cannot leak to the continuum. Symmetry-protected
BICs appear at highly symmetric points in the dispersion of periodic systems.
Although the addition of nonequivalent lattice points in a unit cell is an easy
and straightforward way of tuning the symmetry, BICs in such particle lattice,
i.e., non-Bravais lattice, are less explored among periodic systems. Starting
from a periodic square lattice of Si nanodisks, we have prepared three
non-Bravais lattices by detuning size and position of the second disk in the
unit cell. Diffraction-induced coupling excites magnetic/electric dipoles in
each nanodisk, producing two surface lattice resonances at the $\Gamma$ point
with a band gap in between. %of $\sim$ 41 meV.
The high/low energy branch becomes a BIC for the size/position-detuned array,
respectively, while both branches are bright (or leaky) when both size and
position are detuned simultaneously. The role of magnetic and electric
resonances in dielectric nanoparticles and the change of BIC to bright
character of the modes is explained by the two different origins of BICs in the
detuned arrays, which is further discussed with the aid of a coupled electric
and magnetic dipole model. This study gives a simple way of tuning BICs at
telecom wavelengths in non-Bravais lattices, including both plasmonic and
dielectric systems, thus scalable to a wide range of frequencies."#
physics#physics#applied physics#Honing in on a topological zero-bias conductance peak#Subhajit Pal, Colin Benjamin#"A popular signature of Majorana bound states in topological superconductors
is the zero-energy conductance peak with a height of $2e^2/h$. However, a
similar zero energy conductance peak with almost the same height can also arise
due to non-topological reasons. Here we show that these trivial and topological
zero energy conductance peaks can be distinguished via the zero energy local
density of states and local magnetization density of states. We find that the
zero-energy local density of states exhibits oscillations with a finite period
for a trivial zero-bias conductance peak. In contrast, these oscillations
disappear for the topological zero-bias conductance peak. On the other hand,
zero energy local magnetization density of states shows a periodic oscillation
for trivial zero-bias conductance peak, while for topological ZBCP, they
vanish. Our results suggest that zero-energy local density of states and local
magnetization density of states can be used as an experimental probe to
distinguish trivial zero energy conductance peak from topological zero energy
conductance peak."#

freely as we record the brain's magnetic field is a hot topic in recent years.
Traditionally, atomic magnetometers are utilized for moving MEGs recording and
a large compensation coil system is utilized for background magnetic field
compensation. Here we described a new potential candidate: an optically pumped
atomic co-magnetometer(OPACM) for moving MEGs recording. In the OPACM,
hyper-polarized nuclear spins could produce a magnetic field which will shield
the background fluctuation low frequency magnetic field noise while the the
fast changing MEGs signal could be recorded. The nuclear spins look like an
automatic magnetic field shields and dynamically compensate the fluctuated
background magnetic field noise. In this article, the magnetic field
compensation is studied theoretically and we find that the compensation is
closely related to several parameters such as the electron spin magnetic field,
the nuclear spin magnetic field and the holding magnetic field. Based on the
model, the magnetic field compensation could be optimized. We also
experimentally studied the magnetic field compensation and the responses of the
OPACM to different frequencies of magnetic field are measured. We show that the
OPACM owns a clear suppression of low frequency magnetic field under 1Hz and
response to magnetic field's frequencies around the band of the MEGs. Magnetic
field sensitivity of $3fT/Hz^{1/2}$ has been achieved. Finally, we do a
simulation for the OPACM as it is utilized for moving MEGs recording. For
comparison, the traditional compensation system for moving MEGs recording is
based on a coil which is around 2m in dimension while our compensation system
is only 2mm in dimension. Moreover, our compensation system could work in situ
and will not affect each other."#

researched in many photonic crystals and periodic structures due to a strong
resonance and an ultrahigh Q factor. Some designs of narrowband transmission
filters, lasers, and sensors were proposed based on excellent optical
properties of BIC. In this paper, we consider symmetrical rectangular grating
structure firstly, then cut off the corner of one of the gratings, the Fano
peak of quasi-BIC can be observed in the spectrum. After that, we further
change the tilt parameter of the other grating, which minimizes the Fano line
width. In the momentum space, the process of structural change corresponds to
topological charges split from q=1 into two half charges q=1/2.We analyze
guided mode resonance (GMR) excitation of the grating structure, and discuss
the dispersion relations in the waveguide layer with the position of BIC in
energy bands. In addition, the reflectance spectrum is found to exhibit
asymmetric line-shapes with different values of the asymmetry parameters, M1

broken. This work demonstrates a double trapezoid structure with strong

kton-scale KamLAND experiment has demonstrated the capability to detect reactor
antineutrinos at few-hundred-km range. But to detect or rule out the existence
of a single small reactor over many km requires a large detector. So large in
fact that the optical opacity of the detection medium itself becomes an
important factor. If the detector is so large that photons cannot traverse
across the detector medium to an optical detector, then it becomes impractical.
Gadolinium-doped water-Cherenkov detectors have been proposed for very large
reactor monitoring detectors. Even though Cherenkov emission does not produce
many photons and the energy resolution is poor, there may be a place for
Gd-doped water detectors for the largest of far-field detectors.
In this paper, we focus on the reactor discovery potential of large-volume
Gd-doped water-Cherenkov detectors for nuclear nonproliferation applications.
Realistic background models for the worldwide reactor flux, geo-neutrinos,
cosmogenic fast neutrons, and detector-associated backgrounds are included. We
calculate the detector run time required to detect a small 50-MWt reactor at a
variety of stand-off distances as a function of detector size. We highlight
that at present, PMT dark rate and event reconstruction algorithms are the
limiting factors to extending beyond ~50-kt fiducial mass."#

ion-exchange membranes. The use of thinner ion-exchange membranes is now
possible due to the reinforcement with the carbon fiber fabric. Desalination
experiments reveal that a MEA setup can achieve salt transfer rates equal to
standard setups. Hence, we deduce that charge percolation also acts outside the
electric field. In a single point of contact, ionic and electric charges are
exchanged at the carbon surface of the MEA. The use of thinner membranes leads
to a reduced potential drop. Together with a more homogeneous electric field
across the feed water section, this can compensate for the reduction of contact

logical-qubits. The entangling mechanism is provided by the Fermi scattering of
a Rydberg electron from the plaquette atoms trapped in a qubit-dependent

Subsequent electric circuit modeling of the electrical impedance results the
capacitive properties of the barrier next to the well-known transepithelial
electrical resistance (TEER). The versatility of the new method was analyzed by
the EIS analysis of a Caco-2 monolayer in response to (a) different membrane
coating materials, (b) two different permeability enhancers ethylene
glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and saponin,
and (c) sonoporation. For the different membrane coating materials, the TEERs
of the standard and new protocol coincide and increase during cultivation,
while the capacitance shows a distinct maximum for three different surface
materials (no coating, Matrigel, and collagen I). The permeability enhancers
cause a decline in the TEER value, but only saponin alters the capacitance of
the cell layer by two orders of magnitude. Hence, cell layer capacitance and
TEER represent two independent properties characterizing the monolayer. The use
of commercial chopstick-like electrodes to access the impedance of a barrier

established thermal or membrane-based water treatment technologies at low
energy consumptions. Capacitive deionization processes are normally assumed as
relevant for the treatment of low salinity solutions only. Flow-electrode
capacitive deionization (FCDI), on the other hand, is an electrically driven
water desalination technology, which allows the continuous desalination and
concentration of saline water streams even at elevated salinities. Ions are
adsorbed electrostatically in pumpable carbon flow electrodes, which enable a
range of new process designs.
In this article, it is shown that continuously operated FCDI systems can be
applied for the treatment of salt brines. Concentrations of up to 291.5~g/L
NaCl were reached in the concentrate product stream. Based on this, FCDI is a
promising technology for brine treatment and salt recovery. Additionally, a
reduction of the energy demand by more than 70% is demonstrated by introducing
multiple cell pairs into a continuous FCDI system. While the economic

van-der-Pauw 4-point geometry at room temperature, finding the electron
mobility to reach around 400~cm$^2$(Vs)$^{-1}$, while the 2-dimensional charge
density amounts to ~7$\times$10$^3$cm$^{-2}$. We underline the necessity to
take account of thermal and geometrical-misalignment offset voltages by
evaluating the Hall resistance under magnetic-field sweeps, since otherwise
dramatic errors of several hundred percent in the derived mobility and charge

as CH4 and H2 seem to be the right choice for alternative fuel resources.
However, the most important challenge with this new-faced resource is the
comparatively low volumetric energy storage density. Fortunately, the
high-pressure gas storage technique inside the porous media of solid adsorbent
is considered as one best way to tackle the energy density problem. Famous
family of porous carbon materials, with a suitable pore size distribution
centred in the micropore range and a large number of adsorption sites per
volume of solid, open up a great scope for gas storing applications. This
review article represents the state-of-the-art with a precise focus on what has
and can be done to improve/enhance the gas/energy storage capacity of
traditional and novel structures of low-cost carbon-based adsorbents. We review
a wide variety of design strategies to synthesis carbonaceous adsorbents, with
a strong focus on creating the connection between structural properties and gas
adsorption performance. In this regard, various synthesis techniques have been
studied with emphasis on the more interesting recent progress that allows
better control and optimisation of porosity of porous carbons for maxing gas
storage capacity. We will also show that carbon-based adsorbents, particularly
activated carbons, have been extensively studied and remain a powerful
candidate in the search for an energy carrier economy. In the end, a
perspective is provided to forecast the future development of carbon-based
materials."#
physics#physics#applied physics#Polarization-independent resonant lattice Kerker effect enabled by  phase-change material#Lei Xiong, Xiaoqing Luo, Hongwei Ding, Yuanfu Lu, Guangyuan Li#"Resonant lattice Kerker effect in periodic resonators is one of the most
interesting generalizations of the Kerker effect that relates to various
fascinating functionalities such as scattering management and Huygens
metasurfaces. However, so far this effect has been shown to be sensitive to the
incident polarization, restricting its applications. Here, we report, for the
first time, polarization-independent resonant lattice Kerker effect in
metasurfaces composed of periodic Ge$_2$Se$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) disks. For such a
metasurface of square lattice, the spectrally overlap of the electric dipole
and magnetic dipole surface lattice resonances can be realized by choosing an
appropriate GST crystalline fraction regardless of the incident polarization.
The operation wavelength and the required GST crystalline fraction can be
conveniently tuned over large ranges since these parameters scale linearly with
the disk size and the lattice period, greatly facilitating the design. Making
use of the obtained resonant lattice Kerker effect, we realize a reconfigurable
and polarization-independent lattice Huygens' metasurface with a dynamic phase
modulation of close to $2\pi$ and high transmittance. This work will advance
the engineering of the resonant lattice Kerker effect and promote its
applications in phase modulation and wavefront control."#
physics#physics#applied physics#One-transmitter Multiple-receiver Wireless Power Transfer System Using  an Exceptional Point of Degeneracy#Fatemeh Mohseni, Alireza Nikzamir, Hung Cao, Filippo Capolino#"Robust transfer efficiency against the various operating conditions in a
wireless power transfer system remains a fundamentally important challenge.
This challenge becomes even more critical when transferring power to groups of
inductively coupled receivers. We propose a method for efficient wireless power
transfer to multiple receivers exploiting the concept of exceptional points of
degeneracy (EPD). In previous studies based on PT symmetry, a receiver's
operation has been divided into two strong and weak coupling regimes, and the
power transfer efficiency is constant in the strong coupling regime when
varying the coupling factor.Here the concept of strong and weak coupling and
constant power efficiency is extended to a system of multiple receivers that do
not follow PT symmetry. We show that the important feature to have a roughly
constant power efficiency, independently of the positions of the receivers, is
the existence of an EPD that separates the weak and strong regimes. Our
proposed method demonstrates a system with less sensitivity to the coupling
change than a conventional system without EPD when the receivers and their
couplings to the transmitter are not necessarily identical."#

especially w.r.t three-dimensionally (3D) integrated electrical devices. UV
laser annealing (UV-LA) technology well addresses this challenge. Particularly
UV-LA can reduce resistivity by enlarging metallic grains in lines or thin
films, irradiating only the interconnects for short timescales. However, the
risk of failure in electrical performance must be correctly managed, and that
of UV-LA has not been deeply studied yet. In this work microsecond-scale UV-LA
is applied on a stack comparable to an interconnect structure
(dielectric/Cu/Ta/SiO2/Si) in either melt or sub-melt regime for grain growth.
The failure modes such as (i) Cu diffusion into SiO2, (ii) O incorporation into
Cu, and (iii) intermixing between Cu and Ta are investigated."#

different electromagnetic fields is key to many technologies, from
beam-steering to optical computing. While many techniques have been developed
to optimise structure to achieve specific functionality through inverse design,
designing multi-function materials remains challenging. We present a
semi-analytic method, based on the discrete dipole approximation, to design
multi-functional metamaterials. To demonstrate the generality of our method, we
design a device that operates at optical wavelengths and beams light into
different directions depending on the source polarisation and a device that
works at microwave wavelengths and sorts plane waves by their angle of
incidence."#
physics#physics#applied physics#Phase-field simulations of the morphology formation in evaporating  crystalline multicomponent films#Olivier J.J. Ronsin, Jens Harting#"In numerous solution-processed thin films, a complex morphology resulting
from liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) or from polycrystallization arises
during the drying or subsequent processing steps. The morphology has a strong
influence on the performance of the final device but unfortunately the
process-structure relationship is often poorly and only qualitatively
understood. This is because many different physical mechanisms (miscibility,
evaporation, crystallization, diffusion, advection) are active at potentially
different time scales, and because the kinetics plays a crucial role: the
morphology develops until it is kinetically quenched far from equilibrium. In
order to unravel the various possible structure formation pathways, we propose
a unified theoretical framework that takes into account all these physical
phenomena. This phase-field simulation tool is based on the Cahn-Hilliard
equations for diffusion and the Allen-Cahn equation for crystallization and
evaporation, which are coupled to the equations for the dynamics of the fluid.
We discuss and validate the behavior of the coupled model based on simple test
cases. Furthermore, we illustrate how this framework allows to investigate the
morphology formation in a drying film undergoing evaporation-induced LLPS and
crystallization, which is typically a situation encountered, e.g., in organic
photovoltaics applications."#

mathematics#mathematics#functional analysis#Linear topological invariants for kernels of convolution and  differential operators#Andreas Debrouwere, Thomas Kalmes#"We establish the condition $(\Omega)$ for smooth kernels of various types of
convolution and differential operators. By the $(DN)$-$(\Omega)$ splitting
theorem of Vogt and Wagner, this implies that these operators are surjective on
the corresponding spaces of vector-valued smooth functions with values in a
product of Montel $(DF)$-spaces whose strong duals satisfy the condition
$(DN)$, e.g., the space $\mathscr{D}'(X)$ of distributions over an open set $X
\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ or the space $\mathscr{S}'(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of tempered
distributions. Most notably, we show that:
$(i)$ $\mathscr{E}_P(X) = \{ f \in \mathscr{E}(X) \, | \, P(D)f = 0 \}$
satisfies $(\Omega)$ for any differential operator $P(D)$ and any open convex
set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$.
$(ii)$ Let $P\in\mathbb{C}[X_1,X_2]$ and $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ open be
such that $P(D):\mathscr{E}(X)\rightarrow\mathscr{E}(X)$ is surjective. Then,
$\mathscr{E}_P(X)$ satisfies $(\Omega)$.
$(iii)$ Let $\mu \in \mathscr{E}'(\mathbb{R}^d)$ be such that $
\mathscr{E}(\mathbb{R}^d) \rightarrow \mathscr{E}(\mathbb{R}^d), \, f \mapsto
\mu \ast f$ is surjective. Then, $ \{ f \in \mathscr{E}(\mathbb{R}^d) \, | \,
\mu \ast f = 0 \}$ satisfies $(\Omega)$.
The central result in this paper states that the space of smooth zero
solutions of a general convolution equation satisfies the condition $(\Omega)$
if and only if the space of distributional zero solutions of the equation
satisfies the condition $(P\Omega)$. The above and related results then follow
from known results concerning $(P\Omega)$ for distributional kernels of
convolution and differential operators."#

B, P)$ of a family of tetrablock contractions indexed by a parameter $\alpha$
in the closed unit disc (only the first operator of the tetrablock contraction
depends on the parameter). The dilation space is the same for any member of the
family and the dilation is not minimal. Explicit dilation for the adjoint
tetrablock contraction $(A_\alpha^*, B^*, P^*)$ for every member of the family
mentioned above is constructed as well. This family includes the example
considered in Section 5 of \cite{Pal}. Taking cue from this construction and
using Toeplitz operators on $H^2_{\mathbb D}(\mathcal D_P)$, we obtain
necessary and sufficient conditions for a tetrablock contraction to have a
certain type of tetrablock isometric dilation."#

nonlinear and is homogeneous with degree p -- 1 with p > 2. First, we show that
the energy of the strong solution in the supercritical case decays as a
negative power of t; the rate of decay is the same as in the subcritical or
critical cases, provided that the space dimension does not exceed ten. Next,
relying on a new differential inequality, we show that if the initial
displacement is further required to lie in L p , then the energy of the
corresponding weak solution decays logarithmically in the supercritical case.
Those new results complement those in the literature and open an important
breach in the unknown land of super-critical damping mechanisms."#

$E^s_\sigma$, i.e., $\cup_{r \in \mathbb{R}} H^r \subset E^s_\sigma$. We obtain
the global existence and uniqueness of the solutions if the initial data belong
to $E^s_\sigma$ ($s<0, \ \sigma \geq d/2-2/(m-1)$) and their Fourier transforms
are supported in the first octant, the smallness conditions on the initial data
in $E^s_\sigma$ are not required for the global solutions. Moreover, we show
that the error between the solution $u$ and the iteration solution $u^{(j)}$ is
$C^j/(j\,!)^2$. Similar results also hold if the nonlinearity $u^m$ is replaced
by an exponential function $e^u-1$."#
mathematics#mathematics#functional analysis#Piecewise-Linear Activations or Analytic Activation Functions: Which  Produce More Expressive Neural Networks?#Anastasis Kratsios, Behnoosh Zamanlooy#"Many currently available universal approximation theorems affirm that deep
feedforward networks defined using any suitable activation function can
approximate any integrable function locally in $L^1$-norm. Though different
approximation rates are available for deep neural networks defined using other
classes of activation functions, there is little explanation for the
empirically confirmed advantage that ReLU networks exhibit over their classical
(e.g. sigmoidal) counterparts. Our main result demonstrates that deep networks
with piecewise linear activation (e.g. ReLU or PReLU) are fundamentally more
expressive than deep feedforward networks with analytic (e.g. sigmoid, Swish,
GeLU, or Softplus). More specifically, we construct a strict refinement of the
topology on the space $L^1_{\operatorname{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{R}^D)$ of
locally Lebesgue-integrable functions, in which the set of deep ReLU networks
with (bilinear) pooling $\operatorname{NN}^{\operatorname{ReLU} +
\operatorname{Pool}}$ is dense (i.e. universal) but the set of deep feedforward
networks defined using any combination of analytic activation functions with
(or without) pooling layers $\operatorname{NN}^{\omega+\operatorname{Pool}}$ is
not dense (i.e. not universal). Our main result is further explained by
\textit{quantitatively} demonstrating that this ""separation phenomenon"" between
the networks in $\operatorname{NN}^{\operatorname{ReLU}+\operatorname{Pool}}$
and those in $\operatorname{NN}^{\omega+\operatorname{Pool}}$ by showing that
the networks in $\operatorname{NN}^{\operatorname{ReLU}}$ are capable of
approximate any compactly supported Lipschitz function while
\textit{simultaneously} approximating its essential support; whereas, the
networks in $\operatorname{NN}^{\omega+\operatorname{pool}}$ cannot."#
