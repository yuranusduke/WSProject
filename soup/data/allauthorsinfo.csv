Zhi-Hao Lin#NeurMiPs: Neural Mixture of Planar Experts for View Synthesis#"We present Neural Mixtures of Planar Experts (NeurMiPs), a novel planar-based scene representation for modeling geometry and appearance. NeurMiPs leverages a collection of local planar experts in 3D space as the scene representation. Each planar expert consists of the parameters of the local rectangular shape representing geometry and a neural radiance field modeling the color and opacity. We render novel views by calculating ray-plane intersections and composite output colors and densities at intersected points to the image. NeurMiPs blends the efficiency of explicit mesh rendering and flexibility of the neural radiance field. Experiments demonstrate superior performance and speed of our proposed method, compared to other 3D representations in novel view synthesis.

With the advances of new sensors and algorithms, there is an increasing demand for more versatile datasets. In this work, we contribute HuMMan, a large-scale multi-modal 4D human dataset with 1000 human subjects, 400k sequences and 60M frames. HuMMan has several appealing properties: 1) multi-modal data and annotations including color images, point clouds, keypoints, SMPL parameters, and textured meshes; 2) popular mobile device is included in the sensor suite; 3) a set of 500 actions, designed to cover fundamental movements; 4) multiple tasks such as action recognition, pose estimation, parametric human recovery, and textured mesh reconstruction are supported and evaluated. Extensive experiments on HuMMan voice the need for further study on challenges such as fine-grained action recognition, dynamic human mesh reconstruction, point cloud-based parametric human recovery, and cross-device domain gaps.

Zhongang Cai#Versatile Multi-Modal Pre-Training for Human-Centric Perception#"Human-centric perception plays a vital role in vision and graphics. But their data annotations are prohibitively expensive. Therefore, it is desirable to have a versatile pre-train model that serves as a foundation for data-efficient downstream tasks transfer. To this end, we propose the Human-Centric Multi-Modal Contrastive Learning framework HCMoCo that leverages the multi-modal nature of human data (e.g. RGB, depth, 2D keypoints) for effective representation learning. The objective comes with two main challenges: dense pre-train for multi-modality data, efficient usage of sparse human priors. To tackle the challenges, we design the novel Dense Intra-sample Contrastive Learning and Sparse Structure-aware Contrastive Learning targets by hierarchically learning a modal-invariant latent space featured with continuous and ordinal feature distribution and structure-aware semantic consistency. HCMoCo provides pre-train for different modalities by combining heterogeneous datasets, which allows efficient usage of existing task-specific human data. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks of different modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of HCMoCo, especially under data-efficient settings (7.16% and 12% improvement on DensePose Estimation and Human Parsing). Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of HCMoCo by exploring cross-modality supervision and missing-modality inference, validating its strong ability in cross-modal association and reasoning.

Zhongang Cai#Multi-View Partial (MVP) Point Cloud Challenge 2021 on Completion and Registration: Methods and Results#"As real-scanned point clouds are mostly partial due to occlusions and viewpoints, reconstructing complete 3D shapes based on incomplete observations becomes a fundamental problem for computer vision. With a single incomplete point cloud, it becomes the partial point cloud completion problem. Given multiple different observations, 3D reconstruction can be addressed by performing partial-to-partial point cloud registration. Recently, a large-scale Multi-View Partial (MVP) point cloud dataset has been released, which consists of over 100,000 high-quality virtual-scanned partial point clouds. Based on the MVP dataset, this paper reports methods and results in the Multi-View Partial Point Cloud Challenge 2021 on Completion and Registration. In total, 128 participants registered for the competition, and 31 teams made valid submissions. The top-ranked solutions will be analyzed, and then we will discuss future research directions.

Zhongang Cai#Garment4D: Garment Reconstruction from Point Cloud Sequences#"Learning to reconstruct 3D garments is important for dressing 3D human bodies of different shapes in different poses. Previous works typically rely on 2D images as input, which however suffer from the scale and pose ambiguities. To circumvent the problems caused by 2D images, we propose a principled framework, Garment4D, that uses 3D point cloud sequences of dressed humans for garment reconstruction. Garment4D has three dedicated steps: sequential garments registration, canonical garment estimation, and posed garment reconstruction. The main challenges are two-fold: 1) effective 3D feature learning for fine details, and 2) capture of garment dynamics caused by the interaction between garments and the human body, especially for loose garments like skirts. To unravel these problems, we introduce a novel Proposal-Guided Hierarchical Feature Network and Iterative Graph Convolution Network, which integrate both high-level semantic features and low-level geometric features for fine details reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a Temporal Transformer for smooth garment motions capture. Unlike non-parametric methods, the reconstructed garment meshes by our method are separable from the human body and have strong interpretability, which is desirable for downstream tasks. As the first attempt at this task, high-quality reconstruction results are qualitatively and quantitatively illustrated through extensive experiments. Codes are available at https://github.com/hongfz16/Garment4D.

Zhongang Cai#PTTR: Relational 3D Point Cloud Object Tracking with Transformer#"In a point cloud sequence, 3D object tracking aims to predict the location and orientation of an object in the current search point cloud given a template point cloud. Motivated by the success of transformers, we propose Point Tracking TRansformer (PTTR), which efficiently predicts high-quality 3D tracking results in a coarse-to-fine manner with the help of transformer operations. PTTR consists of three novel designs. 1) Instead of random sampling, we design Relation-Aware Sampling to preserve relevant points to given templates during subsampling. 2) Furthermore, we propose a Point Relation Transformer (PRT) consisting of a self-attention and a cross-attention module. The global self-attention operation captures long-range dependencies to enhance encoded point features for the search area and the template, respectively. Subsequently, we generate the coarse tracking results by matching the two sets of point features via cross-attention. 3) Based on the coarse tracking results, we employ a novel Prediction Refinement Module to obtain the final refined prediction. In addition, we create a large-scale point cloud single object tracking benchmark based on the Waymo Open Dataset. Extensive experiments show that PTTR achieves superior point cloud tracking in both accuracy and efficiency.

Zhongang Cai#Robust Partial-to-Partial Point Cloud Registration in a Full Range#"Point cloud registration for 3D objects is a challenging task due to sparse and noisy measurements, incomplete observations and large transformations. In this work, we propose \textbf{G}raph \textbf{M}atching \textbf{C}onsensus \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{GMCNet}), which estimates pose-invariant correspondences for full-range Partial-to-Partial point cloud Registration (PPR) in the object-level registration scenario. To encode robust point descriptors, \textbf{1)} we first comprehensively investigate transformation-robustness and noise-resilience of various geometric features. \textbf{2)} Then, we employ a novel {T}ransformation-robust {P}oint {T}ransformer (\textbf{TPT}) module to adaptively aggregate local features regarding the structural relations, which takes advantage from both handcrafted rotation-invariant ({\textit{RI}}) features and noise-resilient spatial coordinates. \textbf{3)} Based on a synergy of hierarchical graph networks and graphical modeling, we propose the {H}ierarchical {G}raphical {M}odeling (\textbf{HGM}) architecture to encode robust descriptors consisting of i) a unary term learned from {\textit{RI}} features; and ii) multiple smoothness terms encoded from neighboring point relations at different scales through our TPT modules. Moreover, we construct a challenging PPR dataset (\textbf{MVP-RG}) based on the recent MVP dataset that features high-quality scans. Extensive experiments show that GMCNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for PPR. Notably, GMCNet encodes point descriptors for each point cloud individually without using cross-contextual information, or ground truth correspondences for training. Our code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/paul007pl/GMCNet.

Zhongang Cai#Playing for 3D Human Recovery#"Image- and video-based 3D human recovery (i.e. pose and shape estimation) have achieved substantial progress. However, due to the prohibitive cost of motion capture, existing datasets are often limited in scale and diversity, which hinders the further development of more powerful models. In this work, we obtain massive human sequences as well as their 3D ground truths by playing video games. Specifically, we contribute, GTA-Human, a mega-scale and highly-diverse 3D human dataset generated with the GTA-V game engine. With a rich set of subjects, actions, and scenarios, GTA-Human serves as both an effective training source. Notably, the ""unreasonable effectiveness of data"" phenomenon is validated in 3D human recovery using our game-playing data. A simple frame-based baseline trained on GTA-Human already outperforms more sophisticated methods by a large margin; for video-based methods, GTA-Human demonstrates superiority over even the in-domain training set. We extend our study to larger models to observe the same consistent improvements, and the study on supervision signals suggests the rich collection of SMPL annotations is key. Furthermore, equipped with the diverse annotations in GTA-Human, we systematically investigate the performance of various methods under a wide spectrum of real-world variations, e.g. camera angles, poses, and occlusions. We hope our work could pave way for scaling up 3D human recovery to the real world.

Zhongang Cai#CSG-Stump: A Learning Friendly CSG-Like Representation for Interpretable Shape Parsing#"Generating an interpretable and compact representation of 3D shapes from point clouds is an important and challenging problem. This paper presents CSG-Stump Net, an unsupervised end-to-end network for learning shapes from point clouds and discovering the underlying constituent modeling primitives and operations as well. At the core is a three-level structure called {\em CSG-Stump}, consisting of a complement layer at the bottom, an intersection layer in the middle, and a union layer at the top. CSG-Stump is proven to be equivalent to CSG in terms of representation, therefore inheriting the interpretable, compact and editable nature of CSG while freeing from CSG's complex tree structures. Particularly, the CSG-Stump has a simple and regular structure, allowing neural networks to give outputs of a constant dimensionality, which makes itself deep-learning friendly. Due to these characteristics of CSG-Stump, CSG-Stump Net achieves superior results compared to previous CSG-based methods and generates much more appealing shapes, as confirmed by extensive experiments.

Zhongang Cai#Unsupervised Domain Adaptive 3D Detection with Multi-Level Consistency#"Deep learning-based 3D object detection has achieved unprecedented success with the advent of large-scale autonomous driving datasets. However, drastic performance degradation remains a critical challenge for cross-domain deployment. In addition, existing 3D domain adaptive detection methods often assume prior access to the target domain annotations, which is rarely feasible in the real world. To address this challenge, we study a more realistic setting, unsupervised 3D domain adaptive detection, which only utilizes source domain annotations. 1) We first comprehensively investigate the major underlying factors of the domain gap in 3D detection. Our key insight is that geometric mismatch is the key factor of domain shift. 2) Then, we propose a novel and unified framework, Multi-Level Consistency Network (MLC-Net), which employs a teacher-student paradigm to generate adaptive and reliable pseudo-targets. MLC-Net exploits point-, instance- and neural statistics-level consistency to facilitate cross-domain transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLC-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods (including those using additional target domain information) on standard benchmarks. Notably, our approach is detector-agnostic, which achieves consistent gains on both single- and two-stage 3D detectors.

Zhongang Cai#Delving Deep into the Generalization of Vision Transformers under Distribution Shifts#"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive performance on various vision tasks, yet their generalization under distribution shifts (DS) is rarely understood. In this work, we comprehensively study the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of ViTs. For systematic investigation, we first present a taxonomy of DS. We then perform extensive evaluations of ViT variants under different DS and compare their generalization with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Important observations are obtained: 1) ViTs learn weaker biases on backgrounds and textures, while they are equipped with stronger inductive biases towards shapes and structures, which is more consistent with human cognitive traits. Therefore, ViTs generalize better than CNNs under DS. With the same or less amount of parameters, ViTs are ahead of corresponding CNNs by more than 5% in top-1 accuracy under most types of DS. 2) As the model scale increases, ViTs strengthen these biases and thus gradually narrow the in-distribution and OOD performance gap. To further improve the generalization of ViTs, we design the Generalization-Enhanced ViTs (GE-ViTs) from the perspectives of adversarial learning, information theory, and self-supervised learning. By comprehensively investigating these GE-ViTs and comparing with their corresponding CNN models, we observe: 1) For the enhanced model, larger ViTs still benefit more for the OOD generalization. 2) GE-ViTs are more sensitive to the hyper-parameters than their corresponding CNN models. We design a smoother learning strategy to achieve a stable training process and obtain performance improvements on OOD data by 4% from vanilla ViTs. We hope our comprehensive study could shed light on the design of more generalizable learning architectures.

Zhongang Cai#Unsupervised 3D Shape Completion through GAN Inversion#"Most 3D shape completion approaches rely heavily on partial-complete shape pairs and learn in a fully supervised manner. Despite their impressive performances on in-domain data, when generalizing to partial shapes in other forms or real-world partial scans, they often obtain unsatisfactory results due to domain gaps. In contrast to previous fully supervised approaches, in this paper we present ShapeInversion, which introduces Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion to shape completion for the first time. ShapeInversion uses a GAN pre-trained on complete shapes by searching for a latent code that gives a complete shape that best reconstructs the given partial input. In this way, ShapeInversion no longer needs paired training data, and is capable of incorporating the rich prior captured in a well-trained generative model. On the ShapeNet benchmark, the proposed ShapeInversion outperforms the SOTA unsupervised method, and is comparable with supervised methods that are learned using paired data. It also demonstrates remarkable generalization ability, giving robust results for real-world scans and partial inputs of various forms and incompleteness levels. Importantly, ShapeInversion naturally enables a series of additional abilities thanks to the involvement of a pre-trained GAN, such as producing multiple valid complete shapes for an ambiguous partial input, as well as shape manipulation and interpolation.

Zhongang Cai#Variational Relational Point Completion Network#"Real-scanned point clouds are often incomplete due to viewpoint, occlusion, and noise. Existing point cloud completion methods tend to generate global shape skeletons and hence lack fine local details. Furthermore, they mostly learn a deterministic partial-to-complete mapping, but overlook structural relations in man-made objects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a variational framework, Variational Relational point Completion network (VRCNet) with two appealing properties: 1) Probabilistic Modeling. In particular, we propose a dual-path architecture to enable principled probabilistic modeling across partial and complete clouds. One path consumes complete point clouds for reconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other path generates complete shapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded distribution is guided by distribution obtained from the reconstruction path during training. 2) Relational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design point self-attention kernel and point selective kernel module to exploit relational point features, which refines local shape details conditioned on the coarse completion. In addition, we contribute a multi-view partial point cloud dataset (MVP dataset) containing over 100,000 high-quality scans, which renders partial 3D shapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRCNet outperforms state-of-theart methods on all standard point cloud completion benchmarks. Notably, VRCNet shows great generalizability and robustness on real-world point cloud scans.

Zhongang Cai#BiPointNet: Binary Neural Network for Point Clouds#"To alleviate the resource constraint for real-time point cloud applications that run on edge devices, in this paper we present BiPointNet, the first model binarization approach for efficient deep learning on point clouds. We discover that the immense performance drop of binarized models for point clouds mainly stems from two challenges: aggregation-induced feature homogenization that leads to a degradation of information entropy, and scale distortion that hinders optimization and invalidates scale-sensitive structures. With theoretical justifications and in-depth analysis, our BiPointNet introduces Entropy-Maximizing Aggregation (EMA) to modulate the distribution before aggregation for the maximum information entropy, and Layer-wise Scale Recovery (LSR) to efficiently restore feature representation capacity. Extensive experiments show that BiPointNet outperforms existing binarization methods by convincing margins, at the level even comparable with the full precision counterpart. We highlight that our techniques are generic, guaranteeing significant improvements on various fundamental tasks and mainstream backbones. Moreover, BiPointNet gives an impressive 14.7x speedup and 18.9x storage saving on real-world resource-constrained devices.

Zhongang Cai#Balanced Activation for Long-tailed Visual Recognition#"Deep classifiers have achieved great success in visual recognition. However, real-world data is long-tailed by nature, leading to the mismatch between training and testing distributions. In this report, we introduce Balanced Activation (Balanced Softmax and Balanced Sigmoid), an elegant unbiased, and simple extension of Sigmoid and Softmax activation function, to accommodate the label distribution shift between training and testing in object detection. We derive the generalization bound for multiclass Softmax regression and show our loss minimizes the bound. In our experiments, we demonstrate that Balanced Activation generally provides ~3% gain in terms of mAP on LVIS-1.0 and outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods without introducing any extra parameters.

The vast majority of the academiahas been developing single-camera computer vision algo-rithms, however, little research attention has been directedto incorporating them into a multi-camera system. In thispaper, we designed a 3-branch architecture that leveragesdirect association and additional cross localization infor-mation. A new metric, image-pair association accuracy(IPAA) is designed specifically for performance evaluationof cross-camera detection association. We show in the ex-periments that localization information is critical to suc-cessful cross-camera association, especially when similar-looking objects are present. This paper is an experimentalwork prior to MessyTable, which is a large-scale bench-mark for instance association in mutliple cameras.

Zhongang Cai#MessyTable: Instance Association in Multiple Camera Views#"We present an interesting and challenging dataset that features a large number of scenes with messy tables captured from multiple camera views. Each scene in this dataset is highly complex, containing multiple object instances that could be identical, stacked and occluded by other instances. The key challenge is to associate all instances given the RGB image of all views. The seemingly simple task surprisingly fails many popular methods or heuristics that we assume good performance in object association. The dataset challenges existing methods in mining subtle appearance differences, reasoning based on contexts, and fusing appearance with geometric cues for establishing an association. We report interesting findings with some popular baselines, and discuss how this dataset could help inspire new problems and catalyse more robust formulations to tackle real-world instance association problems.

In this report, we describe a simple way to pass such information in the learning pipeline by adding timestamps to the point clouds, which shows consistent improvements across all three classes.

Zhongang Cai#Siamese Convolutional Neural Network for Sub-millimeter-accurate Camera Pose Estimation and Visual Servoing#"Visual Servoing (VS), where images taken from a camera typically attached to the robot end-effector are used to guide the robot motions, is an important technique to tackle robotic tasks that require a high level of accuracy. We propose a new neural network, based on a Siamese architecture, for highly accurate camera pose estimation. This, in turn, can be used as a final refinement step following a coarse VS or, if applied in an iterative manner, as a standalone VS on its own. The key feature of our neural network is that it outputs the relative pose between any pair of images, and does so with sub-millimeter accuracy. We show that our network can reduce pose estimation errors to 0.6 mm in translation and 0.4 degrees in rotation, from initial errors of 10 mm / 5 degrees if applied once, or of several cm / tens of degrees if applied iteratively. The network can generalize to similar objects, is robust against changing lighting conditions, and to partial occlusions (when used iteratively). The high accuracy achieved enables tackling low-tolerance assembly tasks downstream: using our network, an industrial robot can achieve 97.5% success rate on a VGA-connector insertion task without any force sensing mechanism.

Zhongang Cai#3D Convolution on RGB-D Point Clouds for Accurate Model-free Object Pose Estimation#"The conventional pose estimation of a 3D object usually requires the knowledge of the 3D model of the object. Even with the recent development in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a 3D model is often necessary in the final estimation. In this paper, we propose a two-stage pipeline that takes in raw colored point cloud data and estimates an object's translation and rotation by running 3D convolutions on voxels. The pipeline is simple yet highly accurate: translation error is reduced to the voxel resolution (around 1 cm) and rotation error is around 5 degrees. The pipeline is also put to actual robotic grasping tests where it achieves above 90% success rate for test objects. Another innovation is that a motion capture system is used to automatically label the point cloud samples which makes it possible to rapidly collect a large amount of highly accurate real data for training the neural networks.

Ye Yuan#Self-Supervised Information Bottleneck for Deep Multi-View Subspace Clustering#"In this paper, we explore the problem of deep multi-view subspace clustering framework from an information-theoretic point of view. We extend the traditional information bottleneck principle to learn common information among different views in a self-supervised manner, and accordingly establish a new framework called Self-supervised Information Bottleneck based Multi-view Subspace Clustering (SIB-MSC). Inheriting the advantages from information bottleneck, SIB-MSC can learn a latent space for each view to capture common information among the latent representations of different views by removing superfluous information from the view itself while retaining sufficient information for the latent representations of other views. Actually, the latent representation of each view provides a kind of self-supervised signal for training the latent representations of other views. Moreover, SIB-MSC attempts to learn the other latent space for each view to capture the view-specific information by introducing mutual information based regularization terms, so as to further improve the performance of multi-view subspace clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore information bottleneck for multi-view subspace clustering. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over the related state-of-the-art methods.

Ye Yuan#Online No-regret Model-Based Meta RL for Personalized Navigation#"The interaction between a vehicle navigation system and the driver of the vehicle can be formulated as a model-based reinforcement learning problem, where the navigation systems (agent) must quickly adapt to the characteristics of the driver (environmental dynamics) to provide the best sequence of turn-by-turn driving instructions. Most modern day navigation systems (e.g, Google maps, Waze, Garmin) are not designed to personalize their low-level interactions for individual users across a wide range of driving styles (e.g., vehicle type, reaction time, level of expertise). Towards the development of personalized navigation systems that adapt to a variety of driving styles, we propose an online no-regret model-based RL method that quickly conforms to the dynamics of the current user. As the user interacts with it, the navigation system quickly builds a user-specific model, from which navigation commands are optimized using model predictive control. By personalizing the policy in this way, our method is able to give well-timed driving instructions that match the user's dynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that our method is a no-regret algorithm and we provide the convergence rate in the agnostic setting. Our empirical analysis with 60+ hours of real-world user data using a driving simulator shows that our method can reduce the number of collisions by more than 60%.

Ye Yuan#Adaptive Divergence-based Non-negative Latent Factor Analysis#"High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) data are frequently found in various industrial applications with complex interactions among numerous nodes, which are commonly non-negative for representing the inherent non-negativity of node interactions. A Non-negative Latent Factor (NLF) model is able to extract intrinsic features from such data efficiently. However, existing NLF models all adopt a static divergence metric like Euclidean distance or α-\b{eta} divergence to build its learning objective, which greatly restricts its scalability of accurately representing HDI data from different domains. Aiming at addressing this issue, this study presents an Adaptive Divergence-based Non-negative Latent Factor (ADNLF) model with three-fold ideas: a) generalizing the objective function with the α-\b{eta}-divergence to expand its potential of representing various HDI data; b) adopting a non-negative bridging function to connect the optimization variables with output latent factors for fulfilling the non-negativity constraints constantly; and c) making the divergence parameters adaptive through particle swarm optimization, thereby facilitating adaptive divergence in the learning objective to achieve high scalability. Empirical studies are conducted on four HDI datasets from real applications, whose results demonstrate that in comparison with state-of-the-art NLF models, an ADNLF model achieves significantly higher estimation accuracy for missing data of an HDI dataset with high computational efficiency.

Ye Yuan#Edge-based Local Push for Personalized PageRank#"Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a popular node proximity metric in graph mining and network research. Given a graph G=(V,E) and a source node $s \in V$, a single-source PPR (SSPPR) query asks for the PPR value $\vpi(u)$ with respect to s, which represents the relative importance of node u in the context of the source node s. Among existing algorithms for SSPPR queries, LocalPush is a fundamental method which serves as a cornerstone for subsequent algorithms. In LocalPush, a push operation is a crucial primitive operation, which distributes the probability at a node u to ALL u's neighbors via the corresponding edges. Although this push operation works well on unweighted graphs, unfortunately, it can be rather inefficient on weighted graphs. In particular, on unbalanced weighted graphs where only a few of these edges take the majority of the total weight among them, the push operation would have to distribute insignificant probabilities along those edges which just take the minor weights, resulting in expensive overhead.
  To resolve this issue, we propose the EdgePush algorithm, a novel method for computing SSPPR queries on weighted graphs. EdgePush decomposes the aforementioned push operations in edge-based push, allowing the algorithm to operate at the edge level granularity. Hence, it can flexibly distribute the probabilities according to edge weights. Furthermore, our EdgePush allows a fine-grained termination threshold for each individual edge, leading to a superior complexity over LocalPush. Notably, we prove that EdgePush improves the theoretical query cost of LocalPush by an order of up to O(n) when the graph's weights are unbalanced, both in terms of $\ell_1$-error and normalized additive error. Our experimental results demonstrate that EdgePush significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of query efficiency on large motif-based and real-world weighted graphs.

Ye Yuan#Syntax-Aware Network for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition#"Handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) is a challenging task that has many potential applications. Recent methods for HMER have achieved outstanding performance with an encoder-decoder architecture. However, these methods adhere to the paradigm that the prediction is made ""from one character to another"", which inevitably yields prediction errors due to the complicated structures of mathematical expressions or crabbed handwritings. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for HMER, which is the first to incorporate syntax information into an encoder-decoder network. Specifically, we present a set of grammar rules for converting the LaTeX markup sequence of each expression into a parsing tree; then, we model the markup sequence prediction as a tree traverse process with a deep neural network. In this way, the proposed method can effectively describe the syntax context of expressions, alleviating the structure prediction errors of HMER. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better recognition performance than prior arts. To further validate the effectiveness of our method, we create a large-scale dataset consisting of 100k handwritten mathematical expression images acquired from ten thousand writers. The source code, new dataset, and pre-trained models of this work will be publicly available.

Ye Yuan#On Almost Sure Convergence Rates of Stochastic Gradient Methods#"The vast majority of convergence rates analysis for stochastic gradient methods in the literature focus on convergence in expectation, whereas trajectory-wise almost sure convergence is clearly important to ensure that any instantiation of the stochastic algorithms would converge with probability one. Here we provide a unified almost sure convergence rates analysis for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), stochastic heavy-ball (SHB), and stochastic Nesterov's accelerated gradient (SNAG) methods. We show, for the first time, that the almost sure convergence rates obtained for these stochastic gradient methods on strongly convex functions, are arbitrarily close to their optimal convergence rates possible. For non-convex objective functions, we not only show that a weighted average of the squared gradient norms converges to zero almost surely, but also the last iterates of the algorithms. We further provide last-iterate almost sure convergence rates analysis for stochastic gradient methods on weakly convex smooth functions, in contrast with most existing results in the literature that only provide convergence in expectation for a weighted average of the iterates.

Ye Yuan#Boosting Contrastive Learning with Relation Knowledge Distillation#"While self-supervised representation learning (SSL) has proved to be effective in the large model, there is still a huge gap between the SSL and supervised method in the lightweight model when following the same solution. We delve into this problem and find that the lightweight model is prone to collapse in semantic space when simply performing instance-wise contrast. To address this issue, we propose a relation-wise contrastive paradigm with Relation Knowledge Distillation (ReKD). We introduce a heterogeneous teacher to explicitly mine the semantic information and transferring a novel relation knowledge to the student (lightweight model). The theoretical analysis supports our main concern about instance-wise contrast and verify the effectiveness of our relation-wise contrastive learning. Extensive experimental results also demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements on multiple lightweight models. Particularly, the linear evaluation on AlexNet obviously improves the current state-of-art from 44.7% to 50.1%, which is the first work to get close to the supervised 50.5%.

Our approach is robust to severe and long-term occlusions and tracks human bodies even when they go outside the camera's field of view. To achieve this, we first propose a deep generative motion infiller, which autoregressively infills the body motions of occluded humans based on visible motions. Additionally, in contrast to prior work, our approach reconstructs human meshes in consistent global coordinates even with dynamic cameras. Since the joint reconstruction of human motions and camera poses is underconstrained, we propose a global trajectory predictor that generates global human trajectories based on local body movements. Using the predicted trajectories as anchors, we present a global optimization framework that refines the predicted trajectories and optimizes the camera poses to match the video evidence such as 2D keypoints. Experiments on challenging indoor and in-the-wild datasets with dynamic cameras demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms prior methods significantly in terms of motion infilling and global mesh recovery.

Ye Yuan#Deep Unsupervised Active Learning on Learnable Graphs#"Recently deep learning has been successfully applied to unsupervised active learning. However, current method attempts to learn a nonlinear transformation via an auto-encoder while ignoring the sample relation, leaving huge room to design more effective representation learning mechanisms for unsupervised active learning. In this paper, we propose a novel deep unsupervised Active Learning model via Learnable Graphs, named ALLG. ALLG benefits from learning optimal graph structures to acquire better sample representation and select representative samples. To make the learnt graph structure more stable and effective, we take into account $k$-nearest neighbor graph as a priori, and learn a relation propagation graph structure. We also incorporate shortcut connections among different layers, which can alleviate the well-known over-smoothing problem to some extent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to leverage graph structure learning for unsupervised active learning. Extensive experiments performed on six datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

Ye Yuan#FBNet: Feature Balance Network for Urban-Scene Segmentation#"Image segmentation in the urban scene has recently attracted much attention due to its success in autonomous driving systems. However, the poor performance of concerned foreground targets, e.g., traffic lights and poles, still limits its further practical applications. In urban scenes, foreground targets are always concealed in their surrounding stuff because of the special camera position and 3D perspective projection. What's worse, it exacerbates the unbalance between foreground and background classes in high-level features due to the continuous expansion of the reception field. We call it Feature Camouflage. In this paper, we present a novel add-on module, named Feature Balance Network (FBNet), to eliminate the feature camouflage in urban-scene segmentation. FBNet consists of two key components, i.e., Block-wise BCE(BwBCE) and Dual Feature Modulator(DFM). BwBCE serves as an auxiliary loss to ensure uniform gradients for foreground classes and their surroundings during backpropagation. At the same time, DFM intends to enhance the deep representation of foreground classes in high-level features adaptively under the supervision of BwBCE. These two modules facilitate each other as a whole to ease feature camouflage effectively. Our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art segmentation performance on two challenging urban-scene benchmarks, i.e., Cityscapes and BDD100K. Code will be released for reproduction.

Ye Yuan#Learning Deep Representation with Energy-Based Self-Expressiveness for Subspace Clustering#"Deep subspace clustering has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Almost all the existing works are required to load the whole training data into one batch for learning the self-expressive coefficients in the framework of deep learning. Although these methods achieve promising results, such a learning fashion severely prevents from the usage of deeper neural network architectures (e.g., ResNet), leading to the limited representation abilities of the models. In this paper, we propose a new deep subspace clustering framework, motivated by the energy-based models. In contrast to previous approaches taking the weights of a fully connected layer as the self-expressive coefficients, we propose to learn an energy-based network to obtain the self-expressive coefficients by mini-batch training. By this means, it is no longer necessary to load all data into one batch for learning, and it thus becomes a reality that we can utilize deeper neural network models for subspace clustering. Considering the powerful representation ability of the recently popular self-supervised learning, we attempt to leverage self-supervised representation learning to learn the dictionary. Finally, we propose a joint framework to learn both the self-expressive coefficients and dictionary simultaneously, and train the model in an end-to-end manner. The experiments are performed on three publicly available datasets, and extensive experimental results demonstrate our method can significantly outperform the other related approaches. For instance, on the three datasets, our method can averagely achieve $13.8\%$, $15.4\%$, $20.8\%$ improvements in terms of Accuracy, NMI, and ARI over SENet which is proposed very recently and obtains the second best results in the experiments.

Ye Yuan#Causal Effect Estimation using Variational Information Bottleneck#"Causal inference is to estimate the causal effect in a causal relationship when intervention is applied. Precisely, in a causal model with binary interventions, i.e., control and treatment, the causal effect is simply the difference between the factual and counterfactual. The difficulty is that the counterfactual may never been obtained which has to be estimated and so the causal effect could only be an estimate. The key challenge for estimating the counterfactual is to identify confounders which effect both outcomes and treatments. A typical approach is to formulate causal inference as a supervised learning problem and so counterfactual could be predicted. Including linear regression and deep learning models, recent machine learning methods have been adapted to causal inference. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate Causal Effect by using Variational Information Bottleneck (CEVIB). The promising point is that VIB is able to naturally distill confounding variables from the data, which enables estimating causal effect by using observational data. We have compared CEVIB to other methods by applying them to three data sets showing that our approach achieved the best performance. We also experimentally showed the robustness of our method.

Ye Yuan#Transform2Act: Learning a Transform-and-Control Policy for Efficient Agent Design#"An agent's functionality is largely determined by its design, i.e., skeletal structure and joint attributes (e.g., length, size, strength). However, finding the optimal agent design for a given function is extremely challenging since the problem is inherently combinatorial and the design space is prohibitively large. Additionally, it can be costly to evaluate each candidate design which requires solving for its optimal controller. To tackle these problems, our key idea is to incorporate the design procedure of an agent into its decision-making process. Specifically, we learn a conditional policy that, in an episode, first applies a sequence of transform actions to modify an agent's skeletal structure and joint attributes, and then applies control actions under the new design. To handle a variable number of joints across designs, we use a graph-based policy where each graph node represents a joint and uses message passing with its neighbors to output joint-specific actions. Using policy gradient methods, our approach enables joint optimization of agent design and control as well as experience sharing across different designs, which improves sample efficiency substantially. Experiments show that our approach, Transform2Act, outperforms prior methods significantly in terms of convergence speed and final performance. Notably, Transform2Act can automatically discover plausible designs similar to giraffes, squids, and spiders. Code and videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/transform2act.

Ye Yuan#Backdoor Attacks on Federated Learning with Lottery Ticket Hypothesis#"Edge devices in federated learning usually have much more limited computation and communication resources compared to servers in a data center. Recently, advanced model compression methods, like the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, have already been implemented on federated learning to reduce the model size and communication cost. However, Backdoor Attack can compromise its implementation in the federated learning scenario. The malicious edge device trains the client model with poisoned private data and uploads parameters to the center, embedding a backdoor to the global shared model after unwitting aggregative optimization. During the inference phase, the model with backdoors classifies samples with a certain trigger as one target category, while shows a slight decrease in inference accuracy to clean samples. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that Lottery Ticket models are equally vulnerable to backdoor attacks as the original dense models, and backdoor attacks can influence the structure of extracted tickets. Based on tickets' similarities between each other, we provide a feasible defense for federated learning against backdoor attacks on various datasets.

In e-commerce scenarios, the POI alias problem affects the quality of the delivery address of online orders, bringing substantial challenges to intelligent logistics systems and market decision-making. Labeling the aliases of POIs involves heavy human labor, which is inefficient and expensive. Inspired by the observation that the users' GPS locations are highly related to their delivery address, we propose a ubiquitous alias discovery framework. Firstly, for each POI name in delivery addresses, the location data of its associated users, namely Mobility Profile are extracted. Then, we identify the alias relationship by modeling the similarity of mobility profiles. Comprehensive experiments on the large-scale location data and delivery address data from JD logistics validate the effectiveness.

Ye Yuan#Font Completion and Manipulation by Cycling Between Multi-Modality Representations#"Generating font glyphs of consistent style from one or a few reference glyphs, i.e., font completion, is an important task in topographical design. As the problem is more well-defined than general image style transfer tasks, thus it has received interest from both vision and machine learning communities. Existing approaches address this problem as a direct image-to-image translation task. In this work, we innovate to explore the generation of font glyphs as 2D graphic objects with the graph as an intermediate representation, so that more intrinsic graphic properties of font styles can be captured. Specifically, we formulate a cross-modality cycled image-to-image model structure with a graph constructor between an image encoder and an image renderer. The novel graph constructor maps a glyph's latent code to its graph representation that matches expert knowledge, which is trained to help the translation task. Our model generates improved results than both image-to-image baseline and previous state-of-the-art methods for glyph completion. Furthermore, the graph representation output by our model also provides an intuitive interface for users to do local editing and manipulation. Our proposed cross-modality cycled representation learning has the potential to be applied to other domains with prior knowledge from different data modalities. Our code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Font_Completion_Graph.

Ye Yuan#Temporal Knowledge Consistency for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning#"The instance discrimination paradigm has become dominant in unsupervised learning. It always adopts a teacher-student framework, in which the teacher provides embedded knowledge as a supervision signal for the student. The student learns meaningful representations by enforcing instance spatial consistency with the views from the teacher. However, the outputs of the teacher can vary dramatically on the same instance during different training stages, introducing unexpected noise and leading to catastrophic forgetting caused by inconsistent objectives. In this paper, we first integrate instance temporal consistency into current instance discrimination paradigms, and propose a novel and strong algorithm named Temporal Knowledge Consistency (TKC). Specifically, our TKC dynamically ensembles the knowledge of temporal teachers and adaptively selects useful information according to its importance to learning instance temporal consistency. Experimental result shows that TKC can learn better visual representations on both ResNet and AlexNet on linear evaluation protocol while transfer well to downstream tasks. All experiments suggest the good effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Ye Yuan#Black-Box Diagnosis and Calibration on GAN Intra-Mode Collapse: A Pilot Study#"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) nowadays are capable of producing images of incredible realism. One concern raised is whether the state-of-the-art GAN's learned distribution still suffers from mode collapse, and what to do if so. Existing diversity tests of samples from GANs are usually conducted qualitatively on a small scale, and/or depends on the access to original training data as well as the trained model parameters. This paper explores to diagnose GAN intra-mode collapse and calibrate that, in a novel black-box setting: no access to training data, nor the trained model parameters, is assumed. The new setting is practically demanded, yet rarely explored and significantly more challenging. As a first stab, we devise a set of statistical tools based on sampling, that can visualize, quantify, and rectify intra-mode collapse. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed diagnosis and calibration techniques, via extensive simulations and experiments, on unconditional GAN image generation (e.g., face and vehicle). Our study reveals that the intra-mode collapse is still a prevailing problem in state-of-the-art GANs and the mode collapse is diagnosable and calibratable in black-box settings. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/BlackBoxGANCollapse.

Ye Yuan#Efficient Top-k Ego-Betweenness Search#"Betweenness centrality, measured by the number of times a vertex occurs on all shortest paths of a graph, has been recognized as a key indicator for the importance of a vertex in the network. However, the betweenness of a vertex is often very hard to compute because it needs to explore all the shortest paths between the other vertices. Recently, a relaxed concept called ego-betweenness was introduced which focuses on computing the betweenness of a vertex in its ego network. In this work, we study a problem of finding the top-k vertices with the highest ego-betweennesses. We first develop two novel search algorithms equipped with a basic upper bound and a dynamic upper bound to efficiently solve this problem. Then, we propose local-update and lazy-update solutions to maintain the ego-betweennesses for all vertices and the top-k results when the graph is updated, respectively. In addition, we also present two efficient parallel algorithms to further improve the efficiency. The results of extensive experiments on five large real-life datasets demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of our algorithms.

Ye Yuan#DeceFL: A Principled Decentralized Federated Learning Framework#"Traditional machine learning relies on a centralized data pipeline, i.e., data are provided to a central server for model training. In many applications, however, data are inherently fragmented. Such a decentralized nature of these databases presents the biggest challenge for collaboration: sending all decentralized datasets to a central server raises serious privacy concerns. Although there has been a joint effort in tackling such a critical issue by proposing privacy-preserving machine learning frameworks, such as federated learning, most state-of-the-art frameworks are built still in a centralized way, in which a central client is needed for collecting and distributing model information (instead of data itself) from every other client, leading to high communication pressure and high vulnerability when there exists a failure at or attack on the central client. Here we propose a principled decentralized federated learning algorithm (DeceFL), which does not require a central client and relies only on local information transmission between clients and their neighbors, representing a fully decentralized learning framework. It has been further proven that every client reaches the global minimum with zero performance gap and achieves the same convergence rate $O(1/T)$ (where $T$ is the number of iterations in gradient descent) as centralized federated learning when the loss function is smooth and strongly convex. Finally, the proposed algorithm has been applied to a number of applications to illustrate its effectiveness for both convex and nonconvex loss functions, demonstrating its applicability to a wide range of real-world medical and industrial applications.

Ye Yuan#Dynamics-Regulated Kinematic Policy for Egocentric Pose Estimation#"We propose a method for object-aware 3D egocentric pose estimation that tightly integrates kinematics modeling, dynamics modeling, and scene object information. Unlike prior kinematics or dynamics-based approaches where the two components are used disjointly, we synergize the two approaches via dynamics-regulated training. At each timestep, a kinematic model is used to provide a target pose using video evidence and simulation state. Then, a prelearned dynamics model attempts to mimic the kinematic pose in a physics simulator. By comparing the pose instructed by the kinematic model against the pose generated by the dynamics model, we can use their misalignment to further improve the kinematic model. By factoring in the 6DoF pose of objects (e.g., chairs, boxes) in the scene, we demonstrate for the first time, the ability to estimate physically-plausible 3D human-object interactions using a single wearable camera. We evaluate our egocentric pose estimation method in both controlled laboratory settings and real-world scenarios.

Ye Yuan#Approximate Graph Propagation#"Efficient computation of node proximity queries such as transition probabilities, Personalized PageRank, and Katz are of fundamental importance in various graph mining and learning tasks. In particular, several recent works leverage fast node proximity computation to improve the scalability of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). However, prior studies on proximity computation and GNN feature propagation are on a case-by-case basis, with each paper focusing on a particular proximity measure.
  In this paper, we propose Approximate Graph Propagation (AGP), a unified randomized algorithm that computes various proximity queries and GNN feature propagation, including transition probabilities, Personalized PageRank, heat kernel PageRank, Katz, SGC, GDC, and APPNP. Our algorithm provides a theoretical bounded error guarantee and runs in almost optimal time complexity. We conduct an extensive experimental study to demonstrate AGP's effectiveness in two concrete applications: local clustering with heat kernel PageRank and node classification with GNNs. Most notably, we present an empirical study on a billion-edge graph Papers100M, the largest publicly available GNN dataset so far. The results show that AGP can significantly improve various existing GNN models' scalability without sacrificing prediction accuracy.

Ye Yuan#LambdaUNet: 2.5D Stroke Lesion Segmentation of Diffusion-weighted MR Images#"Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic stroke. DW images (DWIs) are usually acquired in multi-slice settings where lesion areas in two consecutive 2D slices are highly discontinuous due to large slice thickness and sometimes even slice gaps. Therefore, although DWIs contain rich 3D information, they cannot be treated as regular 3D or 2D images. Instead, DWIs are somewhere in-between (or 2.5D) due to the volumetric nature but inter-slice discontinuities. Thus, it is not ideal to apply most existing segmentation methods as they are designed for either 2D or 3D images. To tackle this problem, we propose a new neural network architecture tailored for segmenting highly-discontinuous 2.5D data such as DWIs. Our network, termed LambdaUNet, extends UNet by replacing convolutional layers with our proposed Lambda+ layers. In particular, Lambda+ layers transform both intra-slice and inter-slice context around a pixel into linear functions, called lambdas, which are then applied to the pixel to produce informative 2.5D features. LambdaUNet is simple yet effective in combining sparse inter-slice information from adjacent slices while also capturing dense contextual features within a single slice. Experiments on a unique clinical dataset demonstrate that LambdaUNet outperforms existing 3D/2D image segmentation methods including recent variants of UNet. Code for LambdaUNet will be released with the publication to facilitate future research.

Zicong Fan#Articulated Objects in Free-form Hand Interaction#"We use our hands to interact with and to manipulate objects. Articulated objects are especially interesting since they often require the full dexterity of human hands to manipulate them. To understand, model, and synthesize such interactions, automatic and robust methods that reconstruct hands and articulated objects in 3D from a color image are needed. Existing methods for estimating 3D hand and object pose from images focus on rigid objects. In part, because such methods rely on training data and no dataset of articulated object manipulation exists. Consequently, we introduce ARCTIC - the first dataset of free-form interactions of hands and articulated objects. ARCTIC has 1.2M images paired with accurate 3D meshes for both hands and for objects that move and deform over time. The dataset also provides hand-object contact information. To show the value of our dataset, we perform two novel tasks on ARCTIC: (1) 3D reconstruction of two hands and an articulated object in interaction; (2) an estimation of dense hand-object relative distances, which we call interaction field estimation. For the first task, we present ArcticNet, a baseline method for the task of jointly reconstructing two hands and an articulated object from an RGB image. For interaction field estimation, we predict the relative distances from each hand vertex to the object surface, and vice versa. We introduce InterField, the first method that estimates such distances from a single RGB image. We provide qualitative and quantitative experiments for both tasks, and provide detailed analysis on the data. Code and data will be available at https://arctic.is.tue.mpg.de.

Zicong Fan#A Skeleton-Driven Neural Occupancy Representation for Articulated Hands#"We present Hand ArticuLated Occupancy (HALO), a novel representation of articulated hands that bridges the advantages of 3D keypoints and neural implicit surfaces and can be used in end-to-end trainable architectures. Unlike existing statistical parametric hand models (e.g.~MANO), HALO directly leverages 3D joint skeleton as input and produces a neural occupancy volume representing the posed hand surface. The key benefits of HALO are (1) it is driven by 3D key points, which have benefits in terms of accuracy and are easier to learn for neural networks than the latent hand-model parameters; (2) it provides a differentiable volumetric occupancy representation of the posed hand; (3) it can be trained end-to-end, allowing the formulation of losses on the hand surface that benefit the learning of 3D keypoints. We demonstrate the applicability of HALO to the task of conditional generation of hands that grasp 3D objects. The differentiable nature of HALO is shown to improve the quality of the synthesized hands both in terms of physical plausibility and user preference.

Zicong Fan#Learning to Disambiguate Strongly Interacting Hands via Probabilistic Per-pixel Part Segmentation#"In natural conversation and interaction, our hands often overlap or are in contact with each other. Due to the homogeneous appearance of hands, this makes estimating the 3D pose of interacting hands from images difficult. In this paper we demonstrate that self-similarity, and the resulting ambiguities in assigning pixel observations to the respective hands and their parts, is a major cause of the final 3D pose error. Motivated by this insight, we propose DIGIT, a novel method for estimating the 3D poses of two interacting hands from a single monocular image. The method consists of two interwoven branches that process the input imagery into a per-pixel semantic part segmentation mask and a visual feature volume. In contrast to prior work, we do not decouple the segmentation from the pose estimation stage, but rather leverage the per-pixel probabilities directly in the downstream pose estimation task. To do so, the part probabilities are merged with the visual features and processed via fully-convolutional layers. We experimentally show that the proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the InterHand2.6M dataset. We provide detailed ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our method and to provide insights into how the modelling of pixel ownership affects 3D hand pose estimation.

Zicong Fan#OptiBox: Breaking the Limits of Proposals for Visual Grounding#"The problem of language grounding has attracted much attention in recent years due to its pivotal role in more general image-lingual high level reasoning tasks (e.g., image captioning, VQA). Despite the tremendous progress in visual grounding, the performance of most approaches has been hindered by the quality of bounding box proposals obtained in the early stages of all recent pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose a general progressive query-guided bounding box refinement architecture (OptiBox) that leverages global image encoding for added context. We apply this architecture in the context of the GroundeR model, first introduced in 2016, which has a number of unique and appealing properties, such as the ability to learn in the semi-supervised setting by leveraging cyclic language-reconstruction. Using GroundeR + OptiBox and a simple semantic language reconstruction loss that we propose, we achieve state-of-the-art grounding performance in the supervised setting on Flickr30k Entities dataset. More importantly, we are able to surpass many recent fully supervised models with only 50% of training data and perform competitively with as low as 3%.

Zekang Chen#Unsupervised Multi-Modal Medical Image Registration via Discriminator-Free Image-to-Image Translation#"In clinical practice, well-aligned multi-modal images, such as Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT), together can provide complementary information for image-guided therapies. Multi-modal image registration is essential for the accurate alignment of these multi-modal images. However, it remains a very challenging task due to complicated and unknown spatial correspondence between different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel translation-based unsupervised deformable image registration approach to convert the multi-modal registration problem to a mono-modal one. Specifically, our approach incorporates a discriminator-free translation network to facilitate the training of the registration network and a patchwise contrastive loss to encourage the translation network to preserve object shapes. Furthermore, we propose to replace an adversarial loss, that is widely used in previous multi-modal image registration methods, with a pixel loss in order to integrate the output of translation into the target modality. This leads to an unsupervised method requiring no ground-truth deformation or pairs of aligned images for training. We evaluate four variants of our approach on the public Learn2Reg 2021 datasets \cite{hering2021learn2reg}. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/heyblackC/DFMIR.

Gecko exploits the favourable exponent distribution with a loss-less delta encoding approach to reduce the total exponent footprint by up to $58\%$ in comparison to a 32 bit floating point baseline.

Alternatively, BitChop observes changes in the loss function during training to adjust mantissa bit-length network-wide yielding a reduction of $81\%$ in footprint.

However, characterizing how transformations act on input data is often difficult, limiting the applicability of equivariant models. We propose learning symmetric embedding networks (SENs) that encode an input space (e.g. images), where we do not know the effect of transformations (e.g. rotations), to a feature space that transforms in a known manner under these operations. This network can be trained end-to-end with an equivariant task network to learn an explicitly symmetric representation. We validate this approach in the context of equivariant transition models with 3 distinct forms of symmetry. Our experiments demonstrate that SENs facilitate the application of equivariant networks to data with complex symmetry representations. Moreover, doing so can yield improvements in accuracy and generalization relative to both fully-equivariant and non-equivariant baselines.

Soham De#Unlocking High-Accuracy Differentially Private Image Classification through Scale#"Differential Privacy (DP) provides a formal privacy guarantee preventing adversaries with access to a machine learning model from extracting information about individual training points. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), the most popular DP training method, realizes this protection by injecting noise during training. However previous works have found that DP-SGD often leads to a significant degradation in performance on standard image classification benchmarks. Furthermore, some authors have postulated that DP-SGD inherently performs poorly on large models, since the norm of the noise required to preserve privacy is proportional to the model dimension. In contrast, we demonstrate that DP-SGD on over-parameterized models can perform significantly better than previously thought. Combining careful hyper-parameter tuning with simple techniques to ensure signal propagation and improve the convergence rate, we obtain a new SOTA on CIFAR-10 of 81.4% under (8, 10^{-5})-DP using a 40-layer Wide-ResNet, improving over the previous SOTA of 71.7%. When fine-tuning a pre-trained 200-layer Normalizer-Free ResNet, we achieve a remarkable 77.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet under (1, 8*10^{-7})-DP, and achieve 81.1% under (8, 8*10^{-7})-DP. This markedly exceeds the previous SOTA of 47.9% under a larger privacy budget of (10, 10^{-6})-DP. We believe our results are a significant step towards closing the accuracy gap between private and non-private image classification.

Soham De#Regularising for invariance to data augmentation improves supervised learning#"Data augmentation is used in machine learning to make the classifier invariant to label-preserving transformations. Usually this invariance is only encouraged implicitly by including a single augmented input during training. However, several works have recently shown that using multiple augmentations per input can improve generalisation or can be used to incorporate invariances more explicitly. In this work, we first empirically compare these recently proposed objectives that differ in whether they rely on explicit or implicit regularisation and at what level of the predictor they encode the invariances. We show that the predictions of the best performing method are also the most similar when compared on different augmentations of the same input. Inspired by this observation, we propose an explicit regulariser that encourages this invariance on the level of individual model predictions. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet we show that this explicit regulariser (i) improves generalisation and (ii) equalises performance differences between all considered objectives. Our results suggest that objectives that encourage invariance on the level of the neural network itself generalise better than those that achieve invariance by averaging predictions of non-invariant models.

Soham De#A study on the plasticity of neural networks#"One aim shared by multiple settings, such as continual learning or transfer learning, is to leverage previously acquired knowledge to converge faster on the current task. Usually this is done through fine-tuning, where an implicit assumption is that the network maintains its plasticity, meaning that the performance it can reach on any given task is not affected negatively by previously seen tasks. It has been observed recently that a pretrained model on data from the same distribution as the one it is fine-tuned on might not reach the same generalisation as a freshly initialised one. We build and extend this observation, providing a hypothesis for the mechanics behind it. We discuss the implication of losing plasticity for continual learning which heavily relies on optimising pretrained models.

Soham De#Drawing Multiple Augmentation Samples Per Image During Training Efficiently Decreases Test Error#"In computer vision, it is standard practice to draw a single sample from the data augmentation procedure for each unique image in the mini-batch. However recent work has suggested drawing multiple samples can achieve higher test accuracies. In this work, we provide a detailed empirical evaluation of how the number of augmentation samples per unique image influences model performance on held out data when training deep ResNets. We demonstrate drawing multiple samples per image consistently enhances the test accuracy achieved for both small and large batch training. Crucially, this benefit arises even if different numbers of augmentations per image perform the same number of parameter updates and gradient evaluations (requiring the same total compute). Although prior work has found variance in the gradient estimate arising from subsampling the dataset has an implicit regularization benefit, our experiments suggest variance which arises from the data augmentation process harms generalization. We apply these insights to the highly performant NFNet-F5, achieving 86.8$\%$ top-1 w/o extra data on ImageNet.

Johannes Haug#Standardized Evaluation of Machine Learning Methods for Evolving Data Streams#"Due to the unspecified and dynamic nature of data streams, online machine learning requires powerful and flexible solutions. However, evaluating online machine learning methods under realistic conditions is difficult. Existing work therefore often draws on different heuristics and simulations that do not necessarily produce meaningful and reliable results. Indeed, in the absence of common evaluation standards, it often remains unclear how online learning methods will perform in practice or in comparison to similar work. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive set of properties for high-quality machine learning in evolving data streams. In particular, we discuss sensible performance measures and evaluation strategies for online predictive modelling, online feature selection and concept drift detection. As one of the first works, we also look at the interpretability of online learning methods. The proposed evaluation standards are provided in a new Python framework called float. Float is completely modular and allows the simultaneous integration of common libraries, such as scikit-multiflow or river, with custom code. Float is open-sourced and can be accessed at https://github.com/haugjo/float. In this sense, we hope that our work will contribute to more standardized, reliable and realistic testing and comparison of online machine learning methods.

Johannes Haug#Dynamic Model Tree for Interpretable Data Stream Learning#"Data streams are ubiquitous in modern business and society. In practice, data streams may evolve over time and cannot be stored indefinitely. Effective and transparent machine learning on data streams is thus often challenging. Hoeffding Trees have emerged as a state-of-the art for online predictive modelling. They are easy to train and provide meaningful convergence guarantees under a stationary process. Yet, at the same time, Hoeffding Trees often require heuristic and costly extensions to adjust to distributional change, which may considerably impair their interpretability. In this work, we revisit Model Trees for machine learning in evolving data streams. Model Trees are able to maintain more flexible and locally robust representations of the active data concept, making them a natural fit for data stream applications. Our novel framework, called Dynamic Model Tree, satisfies desirable consistency and minimality properties. In experiments with synthetic and real-world tabular streaming data sets, we show that the proposed framework can drastically reduce the number of splits required by existing incremental decision trees. At the same time, our framework often outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of predictive quality -- especially when concept drift is involved. Dynamic Model Trees are thus a powerful online learning framework that contributes to more lightweight and interpretable machine learning in data streams.

Johannes Haug#Deep Neural Networks and Tabular Data: A Survey#"Heterogeneous tabular data are the most commonly used form of data and are essential for numerous critical and computationally demanding applications. On homogeneous data sets, deep neural networks have repeatedly shown excellent performance and have therefore been widely adopted. However, their application to modeling tabular data (inference or generation) remains highly challenging. This work provides an overview of state of the art deep learning methods for tabular data. We start by categorizing them into three groups: data transformations, specialized architectures, and regularization models. We then provide a comprehensive overview of the main approaches in each group. A discussion of deep learning approaches for generating tabular data is complemented by strategies for explaining deep models on tabular data. Our primary contribution is to address the main research streams and existing methodologies in this area, while highlighting relevant challenges and open research questions. We also provide an empirical comparison of traditional machine learning methods with deep learning approaches on real tabular data sets of different sizes and with different learning objectives. Our results indicate that algorithms based on gradient-boosted tree ensembles still outperform the deep learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth look at deep learning approaches for tabular data. This work can serve as a valuable starting point and guide for researchers and practitioners interested in deep learning with tabular data.

Johannes Haug#On Baselines for Local Feature Attributions#"High-performing predictive models, such as neural nets, usually operate as black boxes, which raises serious concerns about their interpretability. Local feature attribution methods help to explain black box models and are therefore a powerful tool for assessing the reliability and fairness of predictions. To this end, most attribution models compare the importance of input features with a reference value, often called baseline. Recent studies show that the baseline can heavily impact the quality of feature attributions. Yet, we frequently find simplistic baselines, such as the zero vector, in practice. In this paper, we show empirically that baselines can significantly alter the discriminative power of feature attributions. We conduct our analysis on tabular data sets, thus complementing recent works on image data. Besides, we propose a new taxonomy of baseline methods. Our experimental study illustrates the sensitivity of popular attribution models to the baseline, thus laying the foundation for a more in-depth discussion on sensible baseline methods for tabular data.

Johannes Haug#Learning Parameter Distributions to Detect Concept Drift in Data Streams#"Data distributions in streaming environments are usually not stationary. In order to maintain a high predictive quality at all times, online learning models need to adapt to distributional changes, which are known as concept drift. The timely and robust identification of concept drift can be difficult, as we never have access to the true distribution of streaming data. In this work, we propose a novel framework for the detection of real concept drift, called ERICS. By treating the parameters of a predictive model as random variables, we show that concept drift corresponds to a change in the distribution of optimal parameters. To this end, we adopt common measures from information theory. The proposed framework is completely model-agnostic. By choosing an appropriate base model, ERICS is also capable to detect concept drift at the input level, which is a significant advantage over existing approaches. An evaluation on several synthetic and real-world data sets suggests that the proposed framework identifies concept drift more effectively and precisely than various existing works.

Johannes Haug#Leveraging Model Inherent Variable Importance for Stable Online Feature Selection#"Feature selection can be a crucial factor in obtaining robust and accurate predictions. Online feature selection models, however, operate under considerable restrictions; they need to efficiently extract salient input features based on a bounded set of observations, while enabling robust and accurate predictions. In this work, we introduce FIRES, a novel framework for online feature selection. The proposed feature weighting mechanism leverages the importance information inherent in the parameters of a predictive model. By treating model parameters as random variables, we can penalize features with high uncertainty and thus generate more stable feature sets. Our framework is generic in that it leaves the choice of the underlying model to the user. Strikingly, experiments suggest that the model complexity has only a minor effect on the discriminative power and stability of the selected feature sets. In fact, using a simple linear model, FIRES obtains feature sets that compete with state-of-the-art methods, while dramatically reducing computation time. In addition, experiments show that the proposed framework is clearly superior in terms of feature selection stability.

Johannes Haug#Learning Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations for Tabular Data#"Counterfactual explanations can be obtained by identifying the smallest change made to a feature vector to qualitatively influence a prediction; for example, from 'loan rejected' to 'awarded' or from 'high risk of cardiovascular disease' to 'low risk'. Previous approaches often emphasized that counterfactuals should be easily interpretable to humans, motivating sparse solutions with few changes to the feature vectors. However, these approaches would not ensure that the produced counterfactuals be proximate (i.e., not local outliers) and connected to regions with substantial data density (i.e., close to correctly classified observations), two requirements known as counterfactual faithfulness. These requirements are fundamental when making suggestions to individuals that are indeed attainable. Our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we suggest to complement the catalogue of counterfactual quality measures [1] using a criterion to quantify the degree of difficulty for a certain counterfactual suggestion. On the other hand, drawing ideas from the manifold learning literature, we develop a framework that generates attainable counterfactuals. We suggest the counterfactual conditional heterogeneous variational autoencoder (C-CHVAE) to identify attainable counterfactuals that lie within regions of high data density.

Boxiang Lyu#Personalized Federated Learning with Multiple Known Clusters#"We consider the problem of personalized federated learning when there are known cluster structures within users. An intuitive approach would be to regularize the parameters so that users in the same cluster share similar model weights. The distances between the clusters can then be regularized to reflect the similarity between different clusters of users. We develop an algorithm that allows each cluster to communicate independently and derive the convergence results. We study a hierarchical linear model to theoretically demonstrate that our approach outperforms agents learning independently and agents learning a single shared weight. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach using both simulated and real-world data.

Boxiang Lyu#Learning Dynamic Mechanisms in Unknown Environments: A Reinforcement Learning Approach#"Dynamic mechanism design studies how mechanism designers should allocate resources among agents in a time-varying environment. We consider the problem where the agents interact with the mechanism designer according to an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP), where agent rewards and the mechanism designer's state evolve according to an episodic MDP with unknown reward functions and transition kernels. We focus on the online setting with linear function approximation and attempt to recover the dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism over multiple rounds of interaction. A key contribution of our work is incorporating reward-free online Reinforcement Learning (RL) to aid exploration over a rich policy space to estimate prices in the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the regret of our proposed method is upper bounded by $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ and further devise a lower bound to show that our algorithm is efficient, incurring the same $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2 / 3})$ regret as the lower bound, where $T$ is the total number of rounds. Our work establishes the regret guarantee for online RL in solving dynamic mechanism design problems without prior knowledge of the underlying model.

Boxiang Lyu#L-SVRG and L-Katyusha with Adaptive Sampling#"Stochastic gradient-based optimization methods, such as L-SVRG and its accelerated variant L-Katyusha [12], are widely used to train machine learning models. Theoretical and empirical performance of L-SVRG and L-Katyusha can be improved by sampling the observations from a non-uniform distribution [17]. However, to design a desired sampling distribution, Qian et al.[17] rely on prior knowledge of smoothness constants that can be computationally intractable to obtain in practice when the dimension of the model parameter is high. We propose an adaptive sampling strategy for L-SVRG and L-Katyusha that learns the sampling distribution with little computational overhead, while allowing it to change with iterates, and at the same time does not require any prior knowledge on the problem parameters. We prove convergence guarantees for L-SVRG and L-Katyusha for convex objectives when the sampling distribution changes with iterates. These results show that even without prior information, the proposed adaptive sampling strategy matches, and in some cases even surpasses, the performance of the sampling scheme in Qian et al.[17]. Extensive simulations support our theory and the practical utility of the proposed sampling scheme on real data.

Investigating their single-photon emission properties reveals new information about this common radiation damage center, such as its dipolar orientation and its photophysics. We also identify its microscopic structure and show that although this defect does not feature electronic states in the bandgap, Coulomb interactions lead to excitonic radiative recombination below the silicon bandgap. These results could set the stage for numerous quantum perspectives based on intrinsic luminescent defects in silicon, such as quantum integrated photonics, quantum communications and quantum sensing.

Guilhem Madiot#Random number generation with a chaotic electromechanical resonator#"Chaos enables the emergence of randomness in deterministic physical systems. Therefore it can be exploited for the conception of true random number generators (RNG) mandatory in classical cryptography applications. Meanwhile, nanomechanical oscillators, at the core of many on-board functionalities such as sensing, reveal as excellent candidates to behave chaotically. This is made possible thanks to intrinsic mechanical nonlinearities emerging at the nanoscale. Here we present a platform gathering a nanomechanical oscillator and its integrated capacitive actuation. Using a modulation of the resonant force induced by the electrodes, we demonstrate chaotic dynamics and study how it depends on the dissipation of the system. The randomness of a binary sequence generated from a chaotic time trace is evaluated and discussed such that the generic parameters enabling successful random number generation can be established. This demonstration makes use of concepts which are sufficiently general to be applied to the next generation of nano-electro-optomechanical systems.

Guilhem Madiot#Excitation and detection of acoustic phonons in nanoscale systems#"Phonons play a key role in the physical properties of materials, and have long been a topic of study in physics. While the effects of phonons had historically been considered to be a hindrance, modern research has shown that phonons can be exploited due to their ability to couple to other excitations and consequently affect the thermal, dielectric, and electronic properties of solid state systems, greatly motivating the engineering of phononic structures. Advances in nanofabrication have allowed for structuring and phonon confinement even down to the nanoscale, drastically changing material properties. Despite developments in fabricating such nanoscale devices, the proper manipulation and characterization of phonons continues to be challenging. However, a fundamental understanding of these processes could enable the realization of key applications in diverse fields such as topological phononics, information technologies, sensing, and quantum electrodynamics, especially when integrated with existing electronic and photonic devices. Here, we highlight seven of the available methods for the excitation and detection of acoustic phonons and vibrations in solid materials, as well as advantages, disadvantages, and additional considerations related to their application. We then provide perspectives towards open challenges in nanophononics and how the additional understanding granted by these techniques could serve to enable the next generation of phononic technological applications.

Here, we use supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for knowledge acquisition in non-Hermitian systems which accelerate the inverse design process. In particular, we construct a deep learning model that relates the transmission and asymmetric reflection in non-conservative settings and proposes sub-manifold learning to recognize non-Hermitian features from transmission spectra. The developed deep learning framework determines the feasibility of a desired spectral response for a given structure and uncovers the role of effective gain-loss parameters to tailor the spectral response. These findings pave the way for intelligent inverse design and shape our understanding of the physical mechanism in general non-Hermitian systems.

Indeed, the asymmetric response of the obtained complex permittivity distribution is directly related to its area in the complex permittivity plane. In particular, unidirectional light reflection can be designed in such a way that it switches from left to right (or vice versa) depending on the operating frequency. Moreover, such controllable unidirectional reflectivity can be realized using a stack of dielectric layers while keeping the refractive index and gain-loss within realistic values.

Radially dephased periodic refractive index and gain-loss modulations accumulate the generated light from the entire active layer and concentrate it around the structure axis to emit narrow, bright beams. The effect is due to asymmetric-inward radial coupling between transverse modes, for particular phase differences of the refractive index and gain-loss modulations. Light is confined into a central beam with large intensity opening the path to design compact, bright and efficient broad-area light sources. We perform a comprehensive analysis to explore the maximum central intensity enhancement and concentration regimes. The study reveals that the optimum schemes are those holding unidirectional inward coupling but not fulfilling a perfect local PT-symmetry.

Moreover, the level of strain correlated with the amplitude of the bulk disorder peak can be engineered by changing the disorder conditions in the near surface layer.

The pressure/strain can also be induced by the gradually accumulated radiation disorder. However, in semiconductors, the radiation disorder accumulation typically results in the amorphization instead of engaging polymorphism. By studying these phenomena in gallium oxide we found that the amorphization may be prominently suppressed by the monoclinic to orthorhombic phase transition. Utilizing this discovery, a highly oriented single-phase orthorhombic film on the top of the monoclinic gallium oxide substrate was fabricated. Exploring this system, a novel mode of a lateral polymorphic regrowth, not previously observed in solids, was detected. In combination, these data envisage a new direction of research on polymorphs in Ga2O3 and, potentially, for similar polymorphic families in other materials.

The secondary ion mass spectrometry and temperature-dependent Hall-effect measurements reveal that a high density of controllable (GaZn-VZn)- is the predominant compensating defect in Ga-doped ZnO. The binding energy of this complex defect obtained from zinc self-diffusion experiments (~0.78 eV) well matches the electrical activation energy derived from the temperature-dependent electrical measurements (~0.82 eV). The compensation ratios were quantitatively calculated by energetic analysis and scattering process to further validate the compensation effect of (GaZn-VZn)- complex in Ga-doped ZnO. Meanwhile, its energy level structure was suggested based on the photoluminescence spectra, and the lifetime was achieved from the time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. The electron transitions between the (GaZn-VZn)- complex defect levels emit the light at ~650 nm with a lifetime of 10-20 nanoseconds.

Here we report on a study of oxygen self-diffusion by conceiving and growing oxygen-isotope ZnO heterostructures with delicately-controlled chemical potential and Fermi level. The diffusion process is found to be predominantly mediated by VO. We further demonstrate that, in contrast to the general belief of their neutral attribute, the oxygen vacancies in ZnO are actually +2 charged and thus responsible for the unintentional n-type conductivity as well as the non-stoichiometry of ZnO. The methodology can be extended to study oxygen-related point defects and their energetics in other technologically important oxide materials.

Herein, we report a solution to enhancing the conductivity of high-resistance Mg0.51Zn0.49O active components, which has been reliably achieved by fluorine doping via radio-frequency plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxial growth. Fluorine dopants were demonstrated to be effective donors in Mg0.51Zn0.49O single crystal film having a solar-blind 4.43 eV bandgap, with an average concentration of 1.0E19 F/cm3.The dramatically increased carrier concentration (2.85E17 cm-3 vs ~1014 cm-3) and decreased resistivity (129 ohm.cm vs ~10E6 ohm cm) indicate that the electrical properties of semi-insulating Mg0.51Zn0.49O film can be delicately regulated by F doping. Interestingly, two donor levels (17 meV and 74 meV) associated with F were revealed by temperature-dependent Hall measurements. A Schottky type metal-semiconductor-metal ultraviolet photodetector manifests a remarkably enhanced photocurrent, two orders of magnitude higher than that of the undoped counterpart. The responsivity is greatly enhanced from 0.34 mA/W to 52 mA/W under 10 V bias. The detectivity increases from 1.89E9 cm Hz1/2/W to 3.58eE10 cm Hz1/2/W under 10 V bias at room temperature.These results exhibit F doping serves as a promising pathway for improving the performance of high-Mg-content MgxZn1-xO-based devices.

To achieve this, we study $\mathcal F$-hypercyclicity for a family of subsets of the natural numbers associated with the existence of arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. We investigate their connection with different concepts in linear dynamics.

Rodrigo Cardeccia#Orbits of homogeneous polynomials on Banach spaces#"We study the dynamics induced by homogeneous polynomials on Banach spaces. It is known that no homogeneous polynomial defined on a Banach space can have a dense orbit. We show, a simple and natural example of a homogeneous polynomial with an orbit that is at the same time $d$-dense (the orbit meets every ball of radius $d$), weakly dense and such that $Γ\cdot Orb_P(x)$ is dense for every $Γ\subset \mathbb C$ that is either unbounded or that has 0 as an accumulation point.
  Moreover we generalize the construction to arbitrary infinite dimensional separable Fréchet spaces. To prove this we study Julia sets of homogeneous polynomials on Banach spaces.

  We prove that the homogeneous polynomial on $ H(\mathbb C)$ defined as the product of a translation operator and the evaluation at 0 is mixing, frequently hypercyclic and chaotic. We prove, in contrast, that some natural related polynomials fail to be hypercyclic.

Antonio Avilés#Transfinite almost square Banach spaces#"It is known that a Banach space contains an isomorphic copy of $c_0$ if, and only if, it can be equivalently renormed to be almost square. We introduce and study transfinite versions of almost square Banach spaces with the purpose to relate them to the containment of isomorphic copies of $c_0(κ)$, where $κ$ is some uncountable cardinal. We also provide several examples and stability results of the above properties by taking direct sums, tensor products and ultraproducts. By connecting the above properties with transfinite analogues of the strong diameter two property and octahedral norms, we obtain a solution to an open question from [8].

Antonio Avilés#Topological properties in tensor products of Banach spaces#"Given two Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$, we analyze when the projective tensor product $X\widehat{\otimes}_πY$ has Corson's property (C) or is weakly Lindelöf determined (WLD), subspace of a weakly compactly generated (WCG) space or subspace of a Hilbert generated space. For instance, we show that: (i) $X\widehat{\otimes}_πY$ is WLD if and only if both $X$ and $Y$ are WLD and all operators from $X$ to $Y^*$ and from $Y$ to $X^*$ have separable range; (ii) $X\widehat{\otimes}_πY$ is subspace of a WCG space if the same holds for both $X$ and $Y$ under the assumption that every operator from $X$ to $Y^*$ is compact; (iii) $\ell_p(Γ)\widehat{\otimes}_π\ell_q(Γ)$ is subspace of a Hilbert generated space for any $1< p,q<\infty$ such that $1/p+1/q<1$ and for any infinite set $Γ$. We also pay attention to the injective tensor product $X\widehat{\otimes}_\varepsilon Y$. In this case, the stability of property (C) and the property of being WLD turn out to be closely related to the condition that all regular Borel probability measures on the dual ball have countable Maharam type. Along this way, we generalize a result of Plebanek and Sobota that if $K$ is a compact space such that $C(K\times K)$ has property (C), then all regular Borel probability measures on $K$ have countable Maharam type. This generalization provides a consistent negative answer to a question of Ruess and Werner about the preservation of the $w^*$-angelicity of the dual unit ball under injective tensor products.

Antonio Avilés#Banach spaces containing $c_0$ and elements in the fourth dual#"A recent result of T.~Abrahamsen, P.~Hájek and S.~Troyanski states that a separable Banach space is almost square if and only if there exists $h\in S_{X^{****}}$ such that $\|x+h\|=\max\{\|x\|,1\}$ for all $x\in X$. The proof passes through a sequential version of being almost square which we call being \textit{sequentially almost square}. In this article we study these conditions in the nonseparable setting. On one hand, we show that a Banach space $X$ contains a copy of $c_0$ if and only if there exists an equivalent renorming $| \cdot |$ on $X$ for which there exists $h\in S_{X^{****}}$ such that $|x+h|=\max\{|x|,1\}$ for every $x\in X$. On the other hand, although it is unclear whether the aforementioned result of T.~Abrahamsen et al. holds in the nonseparable setting, we show that, under the existence of selective ultrafilters, if $X$ is a sequentially almost square Banach space then there exists $h\in S_{X^{****}}$ such that $\|x+h\|=\max\{\|x\|,1\}$ for all $x\in X$.

Improving results of H.P.~Lotz, H.P.~Rosenthal and N.~Ghoussoub, we prove that $C[0,1]$ shares this property with $c_0$. Furthermore, we show that any infinite-dimensional sublattice of $C[0,1]$ is either lattice isomorphic to $c_0$ or contains a sublattice isomorphic to $C[0,1]$. As a consequence, it is proved that for a separable Banach lattice $X$ the following conditions are equivalent:
  (1) $X$ is linearly embeddable in a Banach lattice if and only if it is lattice embeddable;
  (2) $X$ is lattice embeddable into $C[0,1]$.

Antonio Avilés#Lattice embeddings in free Banach lattices over lattices#"In this article we deal with the free Banach lattice generated by a lattice and its behavior with respect to subspaces. In general, any lattice embedding $i\colon \mathbb{L} \longrightarrow \mathbb{M}$ between two lattices $\mathbb{L} \subseteq \mathbb{M}$ induces a Banach lattice homomorphism $\hat \imath\colon FBL \langle \mathbb{L} \rangle \longrightarrow FBL \langle \mathbb{M}\rangle$ between the corresponding free Banach lattices. We show that this mapping $\hat \imath$ might not be an isometric embedding neither an isomorphic embedding. In order to provide sufficient conditions for $\hat \imath$ to be an isometric embedding we define the notion of locally complemented lattices and prove that, if $\mathbb L$ is locally complemented in $\mathbb M$, then $\hat \imath$ yields an isometric lattice embedding from $FBL\langle\mathbb L\rangle$ into $FBL\langle\mathbb M\rangle$. We provide a wide number of examples of locally complemented sublattices and, as an application, we obtain that every free Banach lattice generated by a lattice is lattice isomorphic to an AM-space or, equivalently, to a sublattice of a $C(K)$-space.
  Furthermore, we prove that $\hat \imath$ is an isomorphic embedding if and only if it is injective, which in turn is equivalent to the fact that every lattice homomorphism $x^*\colon \mathbb{L} \longrightarrow [-1,1]$ extends to a lattice homomorphism $\hat x^*\colon \mathbb{M} \longrightarrow [-1,1]$. Using this characterization we provide an example of lattices $\mathbb{L} \subseteq \mathbb{M}$ for which $\hat \imath$ is an isomorphic not isometric embedding.

Antonio Avilés#A renorming characterization of Banach spaces containing $\ell_1(κ)$#"A result of G. Godefroy asserts that a Banach space $X$ contains an isomorphic copy of $\ell_1$ if and only if there is an equivalent norm $|||\cdot|||$ such that, for every finite-dimensional subspace $Y$ of $X$ and every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $x\in S_X$ so that $|||y+r x|||\geq (1-\varepsilon)(|||y|||+\vert r\vert)$ for every $y\in Y$ and every $r\in\mathbb R$. In this paper we generalize this result to larger cardinals, showing that if $κ$ is an uncountable cardinal then a Banach space $X$ contains a copy of $\ell_1(κ)$ if and only if there is an equivalent norm $|||\cdot|||$ on $X$ such that for every subspace $Y$ of $X$ with $dens(Y)<κ$ there exists a norm-one vector $x$ so that $||| y+r x|||=|||y|||+\vert r\vert$ whenever $y\in Y$ and $r\in\mathbb{R}$. This result answers a question posed by S. Ciaci, J. Langemets and A. Lissitsin, where the authors wonder whether the previous statement holds for infinite succesor cardinals. We also show that, in the countable case, the result of Godefroy cannot be improved to take $\varepsilon=0$.

Antonio Avilés#Abundance of independent sequences in compact spaces and Boolean algebras#"It follows from a theorem of Rosenthal that a compact space is $ccc$ if and only if every Eberlein continuous image is metrizable. Motivated by this result, for a class of compact spaces $\mathcal{C}$ we define its orthogonal $\mathcal{C}^\perp$ as the class of all compact spaces for which every continuous image in $\mathcal{C}$ is metrizable. We study how this operation relates classes where centeredness is scarce with classes where it is abundant (like Eberlein and $ccc$ compacta), and also classes where independence is scarce (most notably weakly Radon-Nikodým compacta) with classes where it is abundant. We study these problems for zero-dimensional compact spaces with the aid of Boolean algebras and show the main difficulties arising when passing to the general setting. Our main results are the constructions of several relevant examples.

On the other hand, an element $x^{**}$ in the bidual sphere is said to be $L$-orthogonal (to $X$) if $\|x+x^{**}\|= 1+\Vert x\Vert$ for every $x\in X$. A result of V. Kadets, V. Shepelska and D. Werner asserts that a Banach space contains an isomorphic copy of $\ell_1$ if and only if there exists an equivalent renorming with an $L$-orthogonal sequence, whereas a result of G. Godefroy claims that containing an isomorphic copy of $\ell_1$ is equivalent to the existence of an equivalent renorming with $L$-orthogonals in the bidual. The aim of this paper is to clarify the relation between $L$-orthogonal sequences and $L$-orthogonal elements. Namely, we study whether every $L$-orthogonal sequence contains $L$-orthogonal elements in its weak*-closure. We provide an affirmative answer whenever the ambient space has small density character. Nevertheless, we show that, surprisingly, the general answer is independent of the usual axioms of set theory. We also prove that, even though the set of $L$-orthogonals is not a vector space, this set contains infinite-dimensional Banach spaces when the surrounding space is separable.

On the other hand, we show that if $\mathbb{L}$ has maximum and minimum then $FBL\langle \mathbb{L} \rangle$ is $2$-lattice isomorphic to a $C(K)$-space. As a consequence, $FBL\langle \mathbb{L} \rangle$ is projective if and only if it is lattice isomorphic to a $C(K)$-space with $K$ being an absolute neighborhood retract. As an application, we characterize those linearly ordered sets and Boolean algebras for which the corresponding free Banach lattice is projective.

Namely, a Banach lattice $X$ satisfies the lattice-lifting property if every lattice homomorphism to $X$ having a bounded linear right-inverse must have a lattice homomorphism right-inverse. In terms of free Banach lattices, this can be rephrased into the following question: which Banach lattices embed into the free Banach lattice which they generate as a lattice-complemented sublattice? We will provide necessary conditions for a Banach lattice to have the lattice-lifting property, and show that this property is shared by Banach spaces with a $1$-unconditional basis as well as free Banach lattices. The case of $C(K)$ spaces will also be analyzed.

This will be the key tool to prove that $L_1([0,1]^{\mathfrak{c}})$ is separably $\mathcal{BL}$-injective, as well as to give more abstract examples of Banach lattices of universal disposition for separable sublattices. Finally, an analysis of the ideals on $C(Δ,L_1)$, which is a separably universal Banach lattice as shown by Leung, Li, Oikhberg and Tursi, allows us to conclude that separably $\mathcal{BL}$-injective Banach lattices are necessarily non-separable.

In particular, in any Banach lattice, the absolute values of any $\ell_p$ sequence always have an upper $\ell_r$-estimate. Quite surprisingly, this implies that the free Banach lattices generated by the nonseparable $\ell_p(Γ)$ for $2<p<\infty$, as well as $c_0(Γ)$, are weakly compactly generated whereas this is not the case for $1\leq p\leq 2$.

Tukey equivalence between partially ordered sets and a suitable extension to deal with $\mathcal{AK}(B_X)$ are used. Assuming the axiom of analytic determinacy, we prove that separable Banach spaces fall into four categories, namely: $\mathcal{K}(B_X)$ is equivalent either to a singleton, or to $ω^ω$, or to the family $\mathcal{K}(\mathbb{Q})$ of compact subsets of the rational numbers, or to the family $[\mathfrak{c}]^{<ω}$ of all finite subsets of the continuum. Also under the axiom of analytic determinacy, a similar classification of $\mathcal{AK}(B_X)$ is obtained. For separable Banach spaces not containing $\ell^1$, we prove in ZFC that $\mathcal{K}(B_X) \sim \mathcal{AK}(B_X)$ are equivalent to either $\{0\}$, $ω^ω$, $\mathcal{K}(\mathbb{Q})$ or $[\mathfrak{c}]^{<ω}$.

Antonio Avilés#Basis problem for analytic multiple gaps#"A k-gap is a finite k-sequence of pairwise disjoint monotone families of infinite subsets of N mixed in such a way that we cannot find a partition of N such that each family is trival on one piece of the partition. We prove that, relative to the comparison given by restriction to infinite subsets of N, for every positive integer k there is a finite basis for the class of all analytic k-gaps . We also build the fine structure theory of analytic k-gaps and give some applications.

Charles Batty#Bounded functional calculi for unbounded operators#"This article summarises the theory of several bounded functional calculi for unbounded operators that have recently been discovered. The extend the Hille--Phillips calculus for (negative) generators $A$ of certain bounded $C_0$-semigroups, in particular for bounded semigroups on Hilbert spaces and bounded holomorphic semigroups on Banach spaces. They include functions outside the Hille-Phillips class, and they generally give sharper bounds for the norms of the resulting operators $f(A)$. The calculi are mostly based on appropriate reproducing formulas for the relevant classes of functions, and they rely on significant and interesting developments of function theory. They are compatible with standard functional calculi and they admit appropriate convergence lemmas and spectral mapping theorems. They can also be used to derive several well-known operator norm-estimates, provide generalisations of some of them, and extend the general theory of operator semigroups. Our aim is to help readers to make use of these calculi without having to understand the details of their construction.

Charles Batty#A Katznelson-Tzafriri theorem for analytic Besov functions of operators#"Let $T$ be a power-bounded operator on a Banach space $X$, $\mathcal{A}$ be a Banach algebra of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$, and assume that there is a bounded functional calculus for the operator $T$, so there is a bounded algebra homomorphism mapping functions $f \in \mathcal{A}$ to bounded operators $f(T)$ on $X$. Theorems of Katznelson-Tzafriri type establish that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \|T^n f(T)\| = 0$ for functions $f \in \mathcal{A}$ whose boundary functions vanish on the unitary spectrum $σ(T)\cap \mathbb{T}$ of $T$, or sometimes satisfy a stronger assumption of spectral synthesis. We consider the case when $\mathcal{A}$ is a standard Banach algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{D})$ of analytic Besov functions on $\mathbb{D}$. We set out the relevant properties of the algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{D})$, and we define the $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{D})$-calculus in an explicit way. We show in particular that the existence of a bounded $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{D})$-calculus for $T$ is equivalent to an integral condition for the resolvent of $T$. The $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{D})$-calculus has been briefly touched on in some previous papers, but our approach is new and it follows the analogous theory for bounded $C_0$-semigroups developed in two recent papers. This approach enables us to prove a Katznelson-Tzafriri theorem for the $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{D})$-calculus which extends several previous results.

Charles Batty#Functional calculi for sectorial operators and related function theory#"We construct two bounded functional calculi for sectorial operators on Banach spaces, which enhance the functional calculus for analytic Besov functions, by extending the class of functions, generalizing and sharpening estimates, and adapting the calculus to the angle of sectoriality. The calculi are based on appropriate reproducing formulas, they are compatible with standard functional calculi and they admit appropriate convergence lemmas and spectral mapping theorems. To achieve this, we develop the theory of associated function spaces in ways which are interesting and significant. As consequences of our calculi, we derive several well-known operator norm-estimates and provide generalizations of some of them.

Charles Batty#Besov spaces associated with non-negative operators on Banach spaces#"Motivated by a variety of representations of fractional powers of operators, we develop the theory of abstract Besov spaces $B^{ s, A }_{ q, X }$ for non-negative operators $A$ on Banach spaces $X$ with a full range of indices $s \in \mathbb{R}$ and $0 < q \leq \infty$. The approach we use is the dyadic decomposition of resolvents for non-negative operators, an analogue of the Littlewood-Paley decomposition in the construction of the classical Besov spaces. In particular, by using the reproducing formulas for fractional powers of operators and explicit quasi-norms estimates for Besov spaces we discuss the connections between the smoothness of Besov spaces associated with operators and the boundedness of fractional powers of the underlying operators.

Charles Batty#The theory of Besov functional calculus: developments and applications to semigroups#"We extend and deepen the theory of functional calculus for semigroup generators, based on the algebra $\mathcal B$ of analytic Besov functions, which we initiated in a previous paper.

Moreover, we clarify the structure of $\mathcal B$ and identify several important subspaces in practical terms. This leads to new spectral mapping theorems for operator semigroups and to wide generalisations of a number of basic results from semigroup theory.

It satisfies the standard properties of functional calculi, provides a unified and direct approach to a number of norm-estimates in the literature, and allows improvements of some of them.

Charles Batty#Optimal energy decay for the wave-heat system on a rectangular domain#"We study the rate of energy decay for solutions of a coupled wave-heat system on a rectangular domain. Using techniques from the theory of $C_0$-semigroups, and in particular a well-known result due to Borichev and Tomilov, we prove that the energy of classical solutions decays like $t^{-2/3}$ as $t\to\infty$. This rate is moreover shown to be sharp. Our result implies in particular that a general estimate in the literature, which predicts at least logarithmic decay and is known to be best possible in general, is suboptimal in the special case under consideration here. Our strategy of proof involves direct estimates based on separation of variables and a refined version of the technique developed in our earlier paper for a one-dimensional wave-heat system.

Charles Batty#Resolvent representations for functions of sectorial operators#"We obtain integral representations for the resolvent of $ψ(A)$, where $ψ$ is a holomorphic function mapping the right half-plane and the right half-axis into themselves, and $A$ is a sectorial operator on a Banach space. As a corollary, for a wide class of functions $ψ$, we show that the operator $-ψ(A)$ generates a sectorially bounded holomorphic $C_0$-semigroup on a Banach space whenever $-A$ does, and the sectorial angle of $A$ is preserved. When $ψ$ is a Bernstein function, this was recently proved by Gomilko and Tomilov, but the proof here is more direct. Moreover, we prove that such a permanence property for $A$ can be described, at least on Hilbert spaces, in terms of the existence of a bounded $H^{\infty}$-calculus for $A$. As byproducts of our approach, we also obtain new results on functions mapping generators of bounded semigroups into generators of holomorphic semigroups and on subordination for Ritt operators.

By constructing some examples of critical behaviour we show that the $L^p$-rates of decay obtained in this way are best possible under our assumptions.

Its core is a new operator-theoretical method of deriving rates of decay combining ingredients from functional calculus, and complex, real and harmonic analysis. It also leads to several results of independent interest.
